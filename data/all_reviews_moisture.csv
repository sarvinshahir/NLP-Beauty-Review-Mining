Byoma Moisturizing Rich Cream has transformed my sensitive skin, quenching its thirst for hydration and soothing its irritability. Rich & non-greasy texture, absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling so soft. Keeps my skin hydrated for up to 24 hours, reducing dryness and irritation. What I love about it the most is, it has ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacin-amide which work synergistically to lock in the moisture, strengthen the skin barrier, and reduce inflammation. It is fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and gentle enough for even the most delicate complexions. 

@byoma Moisturizing Rich Cream has become an essential step in my daily skincare routine. It's the perfect complement to my gentle cleanser and serum, providing an intense dose of hydration and nourishment. Really recommend to everyone!!! 💕",21 CAD

Third, all my products came in perfect condition except for this one.

This moisturizer shines in its ability to plump and soften the skin. It leaves a healthy, dewy glow rather than a shiny finish, which I appreciate. I found it particularly effective in combating dryness and restoring my skin's barrier, especially during harsher winter months. However, the price point is a significant drawback. Lala Retro is a premium product, and the cost per ounce is quite high. This makes it a difficult purchase for many, especially considering that there are other effective moisturizers available at more accessible price points. Gifted by drunkelephant",62 USD

The winter months are especially dry and I enjoy using heavy, thicker creams. Now this cream feels like it was made specifically for my dry skin, I love it! 

The packaging is designed so that you don't have to dip your fingers into a pot, it's more of a jar that you push down to get the product to dispense. I appreciate this especially in terms of cleanliness. 

The ingredients include a Triple-ceramide blend and 5 African oils. I find this really provides the nourishment my skin needs especially in the dryer months. I appreciate that there is no fragrance as my face tends to break out with added fragrance. 

The design of the jar is innovative and I appreciate it as it helps keep the cream sanitary. The packaging consists of a jar that you push down to get the product to dispense. 

The texture of this cream has a thick, whipped, creamy feel. It truly feel like creamy butter. A little bit goes along way and I imagine this will last me 3 months or so (maybe more as we are heading into summer.) It feels very restorative on my skin and absorbs easily leaving my skin feeling hydrated. While the cream is quite thick and buttery, it does not feel heavy on my skin. 

I'd highly recommend this if you have dry skin and are looking for a powerhouse hydrating cream. I give it four stars for the quality, design, and effectiveness. Gifted by drunkelephant",62 USD

One thing I really appreciate about this moisturizer is the packaging — no need to scoop the cream with your fingers, you just press the top and it dispenses the perfect amount. It's such a clean and easy design. The cream itself feels light, absorbs nicely, and seems perfect for normal to dry skin. Overall, a good option if you like practical packaging and a soft, whipped texture.",62 USD

I was hesitant to try this product because I thought it was gonna be another moisturizer I would waste and a lot of other Clinique products don’t agree with my skin but I love this one! I heard it’s a classic and my mom swears by it for her mature skin. I’m 29.  It doesn’t bother my occasional redness, I don’t get acne, it makes my skin feel really soft, it’s even fit for me to put on in the morning when I just splash water on my skin, doesn’t make my skin feel tight or any irritation and I love that it supports the skin barrier.

It only lasted pretty well with a sunscreen when I went out which I think is not what a moisturizer for dry skin should do.

It should be able to act as thick layer of hydration without a reliance to another product. Another thing is it was oily sometimes or too dry sometimes. No in between which was frustrating for a moisturizer from a good brand. Personally I wouldn’t buy it.

I used it for over three weeks day and night. My makeup glided over it so well during the day and my skin felt quite hydrated during the night even with the heaters on Canadian spring. 
I am not sure if I am gonna use it during summer but I like how it can be still lightweight despite being ultra moisturising. I guess because of its ingredients like pure glycerin and pro-lipids that help keep the natural skin barrier.

I use it in the morning before sunscreen and again at night as the last step in my routine. It’s gentle, simple, and it works.

The texture is smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue, making it a perfect base under makeup. It works well for normal to dry skin, providing a healthy glow without feeling too heavy.

However, if you have very dry skin, you might need something more rich, especially during colder months. Also, while it does a great job at basic hydration, it doesn’t have additional skincare benefits like brightening or anti-aging properties.

It has a lightweight, silky texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or heavy residue. My skin feels soft, smooth, and nourished after application, and I appreciate that it layers well under makeup without pilling.

One of the standout aspects of this moisturizer is its barrier-repairing properties. With continued use, I’ve noticed my skin feeling more resilient and balanced, which is a huge plus, especially in harsher weather conditions. I also love that it’s fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skin—no irritation or breakouts, which is sometimes a concern with richer creams.

That being said, while it does a good job of maintaining hydration throughout the day, I find that it’s not quite rich enough for extremely dry skin, especially in the winter months. If my skin is feeling extra parched, I usually have to layer it with a more intensive moisturizer or a hydrating serum to get the level of moisture I need.

Overall, this is a reliable, dermatologist-developed moisturizer that delivers consistent results. It’s a great staple for daily skincare routines, but if you're looking for deep, long-lasting hydration, you may need something a bit richer. Still, it's a solid choice for keeping the skin balanced and healthy!

It applies super easily and doesn't have a greasy finish which is something that is really important to me. During the day my skin remains hydrated and dewy feeling meaning that I don't experience dryness like some other moisturizers. Since it's fragrance free, it also works great with my sensitive skin.

Guaranteed effects.
In addition, the Clinique dramatically different is 100%frangrance free and allergy tested. The ingredients are well-composed. I recommend this product for its quality, comfort, speed of effectiveness, and treatment time.

C'était extrêmement décevant. Je me suis dit que ce serait amusant de l'essayer pour voir s'il pouvait surpasser ma crème hydratante préférée. J'ai la peau sèche et Après l'application, environ 20 à 25 minutes plus tard, j'ai senti mon visage et le produit n'était pas absorbé, laissant mon visage collant et gras. J'ai utilisé la même quantité de produit que d'habitude (généralement 1, parfois 2 pressions), et j'ai été surprise du résultat.

It's specifically a GEL formula for acne prone skin because moisturizer can make us feel greasy, we need a moisturizer that is drying but also hydrates without irritating our skin barrier plus we have lots of oil being pushed through our oil glands hence why we are so acne prone. Please do some actual research before you leave a bad review for a product that doesn't even cater to you !!! anyways. I love this moisturizer i use the whole acne three step line and i have oily/combination skin ! definitely try to get all the products together and use them consistently i used everything once a day for awhile until my skin built some sort of tolerance i suggest you do the same if your skin is very prone to drying. especially if you're using this entire line with the cleanser and exfoliating lotion. These products are for real ACNE. not a little white head from here and there so please do not waste your money on a product that isn't made for you there are a million other products that DO cater to you. More specificfly if you have clear skin , why are you buying this? you should not be using this if you aren't acne prone at all. Don't dis encourage others just because you literally bought a product that's made for oily skin. I will 100% repurchase this once i'm finished this is going to be such a good moisturizer for the summer i'm very happy with my purchases:3",38 USD

It is such a shame because the lotion felt really nice on my face and really promising, but as soon as I looked at the back of ingredients, and I noticed it had ingredients like artificial dyes such as yellow, red, and mineral oil, I had to put it down. I have been on a recent health conscious wellness journey that includes the product that I put on my skin/hair, so I have been opting for products that don't include fragrance or artificial dyes, mineral, oil, pathlates etc., and are more on the clean side. Artificial dyes are very disruptive to our health. I would much rather slather a product that doesnt have an ""aesthetic"" color or fragrance, but that I know will be super beneficial to my skin and overall health. It is not worth it to me to spend almost $40 on a skincare product that will not be mindful of the negative impact of its ingredients. I hope others can also be more conscious of their products as this will be beneficial long term to your health. That being said, I appreciate other clinique products that are afyuakly on the cleaner side. Thank you.",38 USD

bazaarvoice,sephora_ca,P479839,Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Global Anti-Aging Cream,5,2025-08-01 13:22:01+00:00,NeeNeeReviews,"I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 Moisturizer for about 3.5 weeks, and while it's too early to see significant changes (the brand recommends 12 weeks for optimal results), I've already noticed some great benefits. My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays
Keep in mind that everyone's skin type is different, so your experience may vary. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing how it works for me in the long run.

I've been using it for over a week now, and it’s incredibly hydrating which is perfect for my dry skin. One of the things I enjoy most is how well it blends with my foundation or skin tints.

I normally wear their Resilience Multi-Effect Moisturizer Tri-Peptide Face and Neck Creme SPF 15, however I'm finding it a little heavy for Spring/Summer.  This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.

So let me just tell you that after testing a sample of this product for a couple of weeks, I am ready to splurge on the full size product!!

My skin is definitely showing signs of “maturing” at forty years old. I have tried a lot of products over the past few years, both high end and drug store (you know the drug store brand commercials…”better than the $100 cream”). Truth be told, none of the products I have tried for my maturing, combination skin, have blown me away. That is, until this little baby came along. It’s weightless, and makes your skin feel soooo smooth. I love that it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I am definitely noticing a decrease in fine lines.

After using it for a period of time, I can clearly notice that my skin has become more supple and elastic. The dryness and dullness that used to bother me have been significantly reduced.

My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays

This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.  I still stick with my Resilience Multi-Effect Night cream on top of my Advanced Night Repair serum.

I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for a few weeks now, and my skin is obsessed. It’s rich but not heavy, melts in beautifully, and gives me that soft, bouncy feel with zero greasiness. The hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day, and I’ve noticed my skin looks smoother and more radiant—like I actually got 8 hours of sleep. Perfect under makeup, too. Total glow-up in a jar!

First of all, it has SPF 25, which is a huge bonus, especially for those quick moments I am out for a short period of time, when I forget sunscreen.

As a moisturizer, it’s absolutely divine. It glides on like silk, feels luxurious, and leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. The scent is subtle but lovely—clean and elegant, not overpowering.
Also, I worry about breakouts when trying new products and none at all for this. My skin has been loving this. I use it every morning, and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day without getting greasy.

After about a couple of weeks, I noticed my pores were a bit clogged with whiteheads and I had a couple of breakouts.

Second: I have no idea if it is the perfume or the chemicals, but my eyes BURNED...they watered like someone had thrown chemicals directly into my eyes. I am not a particularly sensitive person. Either to scents or ingredients. But this was awful.

My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays
Keep in mind that everyone's skin type is different, so your experience may vary. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing how it works for me in the long run.

I normally wear their Resilience Multi-Effect Moisturizer Tri-Peptide Face and Neck Creme SPF 15, however I'm finding it a little heavy for Spring/Summer.  This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.

First of all, it has SPF 25, which is a huge bonus, especially for those quick moments I am out for a short period of time, when I forget sunscreen. Knowing my skin is protected even during those times is such a relief.
As a moisturizer, it’s absolutely divine. It glides on like silk, feels luxurious, and leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. The scent is subtle but lovely—clean and elegant, not overpowering.
Also, I worry about breakouts when trying new products and none at all for this. My skin has been loving this. I use it every morning, and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day without getting greasy.
I’m genuinely so happy with this purchase and already planning to restock once I run low. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new moisturizer.

The jars lasted me until September. I've started to look around for something new because I feel like I could find something a little more moisturizing. I'm 55 and I feel like I need something a little heavier.

But now that I'm trying other moisturizers, I have a new appreciation for this one! It absorbs very fast, there's no added perfume, it's light and refreshing, you dont have to tug at skin rubbing it in like a thicker cream,  there's no shiny face afterward. I have sensitive skin on my chest and it's never caused redness or any reaction at all.  I even use it as an eye cream without any problem. 

I didn't realize how hard that is to find! I've tried and returned 2 moisturizers already and I hate to do that. If I can't find a replacement soon, I'm seriously considering just sticking with this!",38 USD

I have used Clinique Gel Moisturizer for over 16 years, but it started making my rosacea worse recently and burning my skin.

I received a .95oz sample of this Kiehl's moisturizer from Ulta and was very happy with the ingredients list. I am even more happy with the results!! This moisturizer has transformed my skin. It's happy, clear and nothing in this irritates my skin. My skin LOVES this stuff. This is my new go-to. Even in the humid midwest summer heat, it doesn't clog pores and really does pull moisture into your skin.
