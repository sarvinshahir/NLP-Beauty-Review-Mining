A thin layer goes a long way, you can build it up but I feel it looks best applied really thinly with a brush. i have tried it with a beauty blender and it felt too heavy on my face. As someone with combination skin I do find I have to set with a loose powder in the oiler areas of my face. I use milk hydro grip underneath and set with Laura Mercier loose powder and urban decay all nighter spray. It doesn't move and doesn't separate all day. One thing to keep in mind when choosing your shade; it DOES OXIDIZE, at least on MY skin, I know everyone has different skin chemistry, so this may not be the case for everyone. I ended up going back and buying a shade lighter than what I first bought. I would recommend swatching on your neck or hand and shop around 20 min or so and see if the colour will oxidize on you too. Other than the oxidizing thing I really love it. It's pricey... but honestly one bottle lasts literally forever.",77 CAD

It is beautiful, natural looking and a little goes a long way! The only downside is that the shades are tough to match. I would say I have light to medium skin, but this shade was even too dark for me. I am like a shade 2 lol! It also does oxidize so will turn a bit darker after you apply. I would just test out the shades. Love the foundation though and it doesn’t make my combo skin break out or anything. Also has pretty clean ingredients. Love it!!",77 CAD

bazaarvoice,sephora_ca,2557999,Dior Forever Skin Glow,5,2025-09-16 02:56:02+00:00,PandaMochi,"I think I may have found my holy grail foundation! It was a long struggle as I was deciding between lancome teint idol, dior forever skin glow/matte or haus lab foundation.  I first bought lancome, it was alright but I wasn't loving it and for the price I should be loving it, so I went back and exchanged it for dior. 

I usually go for matte cause i like a soft blur effect (especially around the pores).  Although I always wanted a radiant finish too, I was worried it would look oily or emphasize my texture and pores. However, based on my various research (youtube video), many reported the matte and skin glow version bring similar with slight difference in finish. With the weather getting colder, i do want my skin to be more hydrated, so i got skin glow, and im loving it. It has a slight satin effect at first, especially with powder. The glow becomes more apparent over time, but it won't look oily but actually more skin like with a healthy hydrated look. It's still transfer proof and longevity it good too. By the 9h work, it started to separate but only a little, and it's very easy to fix up without it affecting the rest of the face.

I actually compared it with haus lab (i got a sample) cause I heard great things about it, and i really love how haus lab looked on my hand when I was swatch both in the store. It was smoother and more radiant than dior but also seems it would transfer more. When trying both on with powder, the transfer is no longer an issue. Interestingly, at first, haus lab looked more radiant AND powdery than dior, which looks soft and skin like. But after a while, both looked skin like but haus lab did settle into my pores a bit more. It also doesn't last as long as dior, since it started breaking apart around the 7h mark, but like dior it's easy to fix up without it affecting rest of the face.",77 CAD

It gives such a smooth and satin finish, gives decent coverage without being cakey at all. I have normal to dry skin, and this does not oxidize on me. I find it to be the same shade after many hours.

bazaarvoice,sephora_ca,2557999,Dior Forever Skin Glow,5,2025-04-20 17:23:10+00:00,,"BOMB BOMB BOMB I am obsessed. Perfect balance between sheer and medium coverage. Depending on how I feel and the look I want that day, I often just wear this as my base after moisturizer and primer and then add a little more under my eyes and-boom, perfect. Not only does it FEEL light, it hydrates dull skin without leaving a greasy film. My skin looks radiant and Dior Forever Skin Glow Hydrating Foundation has become a STAPLE in my makeup routine. 

OH BUT BEWARE — TEST THESE SHADES IN PERSON AT A STORE. Their naming system is very off (at least I found it to be). 

For some background, I have always been neutral toned, I have both green and blue veins in my arms and am a darn-near greenish yellow-olive undertone to my skin and go brown in the summer (no red, no pink, just golden brown). I spent over an HOUR testing all the different shades and tones and finally came to 0W. It is my EXACT match right now, however, it’ll be a different story when my skin sees the sun. Highly highly recommend going IN STORE and trying all of the shades because I never would have guessed I’d be “warm”.",77 CAD

It feels great on my skin and doesn’t look heavy even when you build it up to super full coverage, on a day to day I can achieve a light to medium coverage with it and it lasts the whole day. 

It isn’t transfer-proof but the way my skin looks and feels so healthy and glowy but not oily is perfect. There’s no weird clinging to dry patches, or separation due to oil. I really enjoy this foundation and highly recommend it just keep in mind it does oxidize when you’re shade matching!",77 CAD

I wish I had bought it back when Wayne Goss first raved about it. I start by shaking the bottle, applying a pump to the back of my hand and mixing it with my finger before applying it in dots across my face.m, and then I use a sponge to blend it. The foundation perfects the skin, making it look hydrated, alive, and healthy. It can be layered without ever looking heavy. It never separated on me, and looks so natural that I keep being told I have beautiful skin instead of nice makeup. I work and attend nursing school full time and even by the end of the day this foundation never separates on me or gets oily. I have recommended it to my mom in her mid 50s, and she loves it as well. I was paranoid to review it as I didn’t want to jinx it (I had reviewed the dior airflash foundation before it was DCd and loved it, then it broke me out).

The coverage and look were decent. I liked the finish for the most part, though it doesn't look like skin as much as many foundations. It definitely is a you're wearing makeup foundation.

1) The makeup just sucks. It oxidizes, or comes out of the tube darker or some other tone than it used to, and generally doesn't match what it used to. 

2) It breaks you out. A makeup that used to be the HG for breakout-prone girlies is now part of the problem because they force ""skincare"" into the formula. So those of us who spent years hunting and came to rely on a foundation now have to abandon it and are shunned as loyal customers. 

3) It separates. More often than not, the ""skincare"" being blindly mixed into these foundations is not meant to mix with the types of formulas in the makeup. So you end up with a foundation that ends up separating on your face and looking disgusting, whereas the original formula used to last an entire day, .

I am so deeply disappointed and frustrated with the makeup industry lately. I can barely find a single cosmetic that doesn’t tout some “skin saving” ingredient anymore, and all I want is a simple foundation and concealer. I’m not interested in paying more for makeup that doesn’t even work half as well as it used to.

Please please PLEASE go back to just letting makeup be makeup, and skincare be skincare.",73 CAD

I have a really hard time finding foundations that look good on my skin. I have combination skin and every foundation either makes my my skin too oily or clings to dry patches. Estee Lauder Double Wear has always been my holy grail as it’s the only thing that has stayed on flawlessly for hours. As I’m getting older, I’m getting more fine lines that are emphasized with the EL formula so I started looking for something more lightweight. That’s where this foundation comes in. It is amazing!! So hydrating but does not make my skin oily at all. I was able to wear it yesterday for 12 hours and have it not separate or get oily. And it makes your skin look like skin, but better. Also, for girlies like me that are starting to get fine lines, this foundation is amazing and helps hide those.

I use it on myself and on my clients and I have never had any issues with it. looks beautiful on dry skin, oily, acne prone, mature skin. I’ve tested it on all skin types when doing makeup and it looks beautiful on everybody. this foundation has a beautiful medium coverage that you can sheer out to a tint if you like, and that you can layer to full coverage without it getting cakey. it also wears well and performs beautifully throughout the day, if set properly it lasts the entire day and the days I don’t set it it still lasts well and wears away in a way that doesn’t look too bad at the end of the day. I’ll maybe just have some smudging around the area my glasses sit which is typical of all foundations for me if I don’t set them properly.

I first received this product as a free training product but I have since then repurchased it because I love the formula so so much. out of all foundations sold at sephora, this is my favourite natural-looking foundation.

Previously, I was using the sheer glow foundation in Deauville. That shade matched me perfectly but sometimes that formula would show dry spots on my face. When I read the reviews for this eyeshadow a lot of the users had mature skin and said that it did not accent those flaws that come with aging skin. I'm 40, and so far I found this to be true! I do always use an oil or a lotion plus a sunscreen on my face and I haven't noticed anything standing out yet. I do find that this foundation is a little more watery than my other foundations even when I shake it up. But I don't mind that at all. The other thing I did notice is the shade is definitely different sheer glow. I got the same shade, Deauville and it's significantly darker. So I did go online and purchase the shade lighter and I'll see how that goes. Worst case scenario I figure I can mix the two based off of my skin tone at the moment. I do tend to darken up in the summer, like most people. But as far as the formula goes, it's great! It doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin, I like that there's no smell, and it has great coverage for me.",73 CAD

It was constantly recommended to me at cosmetics stores. Alas, none of the fair tones matched my skin. They were all way too yellow or way too pink. I generally opt for neutral foundations. My old favorite foundation was discontinued (yet again), so on my most recent search for a new one, I discovered this new Yulong shade. A different fair neutral from NARS. I tested it on my neck and was amazed by the color match. I immediately purchased it and I have used it ever since. The finish is beautiful. It's not too heavy on my sensitive skin, has the perfect buildable light-medium coverage, and lasts all day. It sets nicely on top of my Natasha Denona primer and stays with the now obsolete UD setting spray. All of my other products- mostly powder, some liquid and cream blushes- blend nicely into it without my base breaking or fading. I truly cannot see myself ever switching to another foundation as long as this formula stays the same and this shade remains in stock. I have the hardest time color matching and my shade seems to get discontinued often on other product lines, so I worry this shade won't be popular enough to keep around but fingers crossed. For reference, I'm a 125 Fenty and a 0N Dior.",73 CAD

Yes,  that's how runny it is,  even when rubbing into my face.  I looked like a wet wax face.  It felt uncomfortable like I wanted to itch it off. Even with a setting powder it was wet.  Other makeup did NOT blend well at all either. Side note,  I have PCOS, so I need full coverage.  This is probably the furthest from medium/full/build able coverage.  So it's a huge no for me.  Not only that,  during the day I kept getting a wiff of something rancid on my face.  I have sensitive skin. Made where I shave,  turn red and seap through.  I'll stick with what I use.

I'm older and it does not settle into lines on my face. The color looks good. It does have a bit of a problem adhering to the skin on my nose so I'm in the process of finding a primer for this issue. Why I'm writing this review is to warn others that the glass bottle neck can get permanent stuck inside the black plastic lid of the product. I had to spend money and order a second bottle because I could not get the bottle out once it got stuck and I could not completely close the bottle. I'm not the only person with this problem as evidenced by some reviews here and elsewhere online. This is so upsetting. I hope NARS changes their bottles so this won't keep happening.

It was my go-to for a flawless, long-lasting finish, and I always loved how it could keep my skin looking matte and perfect all day without budging. But recently, it seems like their formula changed. It’s patchy, cakey, and just doesn’t sit well on my skin anymore. No matter how I apply it, whether with a brush or sponge, it starts to look uneven and accentuates texture, something I never had issues with before. It’s almost like the formula doesn’t blend as smoothly or provide the same airbrushed effect it used to.

I’ve tried everything! Different primers, different skincare routines, but nothing brings back that flawless finish I once loved. It’s such a shame because for years this was the perfect foundation for me, and now I can’t even wear it without feeling like it’s making my skin look worse.

So, I was a Smashbox, Studio Skin 24 Hour Wear Hydrating Foundation girlie for YEARS and then the very unfortunate day came where they discontinued it. I was smart and stock pile bought several bottles to keep me going for at least a year and a half to hold me over until I could search for something that was just as good. I knew it would be a VERY daunting journey because lets face it, Smashbox Studio Skin was literal perfection. Fast forward to now. Just started on my last bottle of Smashbox Studio Skin and unfortunately know the time has come to start my search for what is an irreplaceable product. I've tried Milk, Yensa, and other foundations up to this point and honey, it's a no for me. I'm 38. Very minimal lines and no wrinkles (thank God) for now however, those lines and laugh lines that happen through out the day around the brow and eyes can look worse with makeup on than they do without makeup. My biggest hurdle with foundations was the creasing and the often times, icky damp feeling that I would get after 8 hours of wear. I went to Sephora to get samples of a few foundations I had been eyeing. They didn't have those foundations at that store however, they talked me into trying this Estee Lauder Double Wear. For the record I would have NEVER even thought to try this due to some of the reviews so, I was like sure, it's a free sample, why not try it. THIS IS IT. My flabbers are GASTED. I wore this on a Saturday just in case it made me look gross throughout the day and honey, it survived an all day session of painting our house, physically intense house work with near ZERO creasing and kept me matte and honestly looking like I just put on a fresh face of makeup even though I had been wearing it for over 10 hours. I AM FLOORED. I will say, it is a bit drier that I'm used too however, I will take it. Finally a foundation that does not make me look 50 years old after 8 hours of wear.

I’ve been a loyal Double Wear user for over 10 years (and even worked for Estée Lauder (& Sephora) in the past), and it has always been my holy grail foundation. Unfortunately, my most recent bottle from Sephora caused a severe allergic reaction and eczema flare-up. I’ve dealt with swollen eyes, rashes on my eyelids, under my nose, and around my mouth, and it took me over a month to figure out the culprit was Double Wear.

I completely overhauled my skincare routine thinking something else was to blame, and relied on prescription steroid cream just to manage the symptoms—only for the flare-ups to return. Once I eliminated Double Wear, my skin started improving.

I haven’t seen any official word on a reformulation, but something seems different. I’m so sad, because nothing compares to Double Wear, and I wish this wasn’t the case. :(",70.5 CAD

Overall, I preferred the sheer, but it's been discontinued, so here we are.  Things I like:  I do love that the colors are the same across both foundations, and that they really ARE the same.  I kept my same color, and it's just as good as it always was.  Things that I don't love:  (a) this is not as smooth and easy to spread as the Double Wear Sheer was.  It's workable, but not nearly as easy to apply; (b) I do not like the glass bottle at all.  The plastic squeeze bottle was easier to manage, easier to dispense the product, and easier to travel with.  Also, unbreakable ~ a bonus in the bathroom where many of us apply makeup.  The glass bottle doesn't lend itself to easy application with a brush, a sponge, your fingers....nothing really.  Overall, it's workable, and I'm not likely to change.  But I do question why those of us who used the Double Wear Sheer are forced to convert to the heavier Double Wear, or change product lines/manufacturers altogether.",67 CAD

I would agree that this provides medium coverage. That is sufficient for me as I don't have intense dark circles around my eye area. I think if you do have darker circles this in tandem with a color corrector would work quite well.

The formula is creamy and easy to apply. The applicator is a large doe foot that holds a fair amount of product. The product dries down to be matte and has a skin like finish. It blends out well into my makeup and is comfortable on my skin. I was satisfied with the longevity of the coverage but can't say for certain if it lasts 24 hours as I don't wear makeup that long…

I will say since it has a natural matte finish, it was important that I really hydrated my skin prior to applying this concealer. If I didn't it would settle a bit more into the lines on my face. Not a huge deal for me as most concealers perform much better with a fully prepped face.

The shelf life is 6 months. This gives me a bit of pause as I am not sure I can finish this all in 6 months. It would be great to have a mini one that's also half the price. 

I'd recommend this if you can find the perfect shade match as I really enjoy the formula!",67 CAD

It has gone through at least 3 noticeable formula changes in that time. It started out as a thick, opaque, full coverage, everything-proof foundation and is now a mediocre, medium-at-best coverage, normal liquid foundation. The last two bottles I bought have oxidized in the bottle within 6-8 months, even when used with a pump immediately upon opening (so it is not exposed by the bottle opening) and being kept in a drawer. That alone will keep me from buying another. I also get oily after a few hours, even with proper prep and set. It oxidizes on my face over the course of the day and wipes off in places easily, so it looks patchy at various times as well. This just isn't the best on the market anymore and the price point is absurd for the lesser quality. I appreciate that it never causes issues for my acne prone skin and that it doesn't have a scent. The shades run very peachy and there is not a true olive shade (once it dries down and/or changes color over the day). There used to be 2 great olive shades I could wear before the last reformulation. I haven't found a proper shade since, and resorted to using a color corrector bc I thought I liked the formula.

I love the coverage and always end up using too much because it doesn't have a pump. I have seen pumps for this on the internet and must remember to get one. You have to shake this formula to get the best out of it. It does last a really long time and it doesn't break apart. I think it's supposed to be a medium coverage and you are supposed to see your skin/freckels underneath it. I was trying to cover redness and used too much of this.
I think I used too much powder and too much foundation because I stopped using this after a few bad days with my makeup looking to heavy. I liked it better when I really prepped my skin with moisturizer and primer. If you have dryness and texture problems they can get magnified by the dry down of this formula. It's a super long lasting formula and is supposed to dry down, so it accomplishes that well. I didn't have a dewy setting spray at the time so I used what I had but I think it looks better after it's been worn for two hours or so. I think you need to be better than a beginner to use this. It needs the right supporting products to go with it. A setting spray that softens it, something like a primer to save the texture/pores you see, the right powder, and the nearly 60 shades to choose from makes it kind of tricky to use.
I tried it out because I got it on sale but I think I prefer others over this. I'm just getting back into makeup and need something a little more forgiving .",52 USD

But, I wanted to explore other options to see if a higher quality brand and formula might be worth it. I don't love Fit Me, but it's worked well enough.

However, it may not be for everyone. Anyone looking for full or matte coverage should look to others brands. If you are looking for light to medium coverage with a mildly radiant finish, thisi is the best.

Giorgio Armani luminous silk - color 5.75

I haven't worn foundation in decades. The closest I've gotten has been tinted moisturizer from Walmart. 

Well, my skin has changed a lot in the past 15 years. I will be turning 60 next year, and I have acute liver disease.  I need more coverage than I have in the past because liver health directly impacts skin condition. 

I had been having trouble selecting an appropriate foundation color. The online color quizzes always ask what foundation I am already using. That is useless in my situation. 

So, I purchased 4 foundations and saved up all of my freebies to color test at home.

Armani's luminous silk not only matched well, but it also has an appropriate amount of coverage.

Now, I just need to wait for it to be back in stock.",85 CAD

Right off the bat after ONE day of using it again, my skin immediately breaks out horribly. This was the only new product in my routine. I thought maybe it was just stress hormones or acne, but after the 4th day i stopped immediately as it just kept getting worse and worse.  A week later, my skin was 90% clear!  Also, throughout the 4 days i realized my makeup was very patchy and cracked after a couple of hours and VERY noticeable in person! i hydrated my skin a lot thinking it would solve the issue, but it still kept creasing. Lastly, it oxidizes almost immediately. If it didn’t oxidize as soon it made contact with skin, then it 1000% will after setting powder. i changed setting powders, moisturizer, techniques but all these issues were consistent. Sadly, i threw out the packaging of the foundation so now it’s just collecting disht lol.

They have a diverse range of shades and coverage to match my darker skin. This gave me such smooth effortless coverage, I didn’t need any blending, any powder, any blush – nothing else. I put this foundation on in the morning and wear it all day, it stays looking effortless all day. It has a light scent that fades once it dries and the product dries quickly. I also love that sunscreen is also right in the product, so I don’t have to apply a separate sunscreen before applying foundation and then risking my skin feeling oily or sweaty in the Southern heat. Best of all, this foundation is well-suited to all day wear, it minimizes my pores and causes no irritation. Even though I wore this foundation on days when it has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the product has not sweated off.

One of the standout features for me is how weightless it feels on the skin, it’s like wearing nothing, but with great medium to full build able coverage. The semi-matte finish is beautiful and looks so natural and smooth. 

I have oily skin so I wore it with the Hourglass Veil primer and was impressed with how well it held up throughout the day. Even when my natural oils started to come through in the evening, it didn’t look greasy at all. Instead, it gave my skin a subtle dewy glow that looked fresh rather than shiny.

The only downside I noticed is with the shade range or the accuracy of the shades. When I first received it, I thought the color would be way too dark 345N , but it turned out to be a perfect summer match. Typically I would have picked a color in the 200N range considering I fall in the light skin tone range. To be honest, even for a summer shade I would have never gotten 345N which is for medium skin tone, assuming it would be far too dark. Usually for my summer shade I get a light medium shade. If I had picked it out myself based on what I usually go for, I probably would’ve ended up with something way too light. So definitely try it in person if you can. All in all, I absolutely love this foundation and will be purchasing it myself once I finish this bottle.",76 CAD

I put it on after allowing my moisturizer to dry and I was so surprised how well it blended into my skin since I never have good results with foundation matching. But Lancome said we got you! They have a diverse range of shades and coverage to match my darker skin. This gave me such smooth effortless coverage, I didn't need any blending, any powder, any blush – nothing else. I put this foundation on in the morning and wear it all day, it stays looking effortless all day. It has a light scent that fades once it dries and the product dries quickly. I also love that sunscreen is also right in the product, so I don't have to apply a separate sunscreen before applying foundation and then risking my skin feeling oily or sweaty in the Southern heat. Best of all, this foundation is well-suited to all day wear, it minimizes my pores and causes no irritation. Even though I wore this foundation on days when it has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the product has not sweated off.

The main reason for my loyalty has been my super pale skin. 90N of this foundation has historically been the only foundation available without special ordering that matches my skin and doesn't cause other problems. It is also been very longlasting. But in the last year or so they have CHANGED the color of 90N. I was hoping it was fluke, but its not. It is now too dark/orange for my skin. And there's no shade that's lighter.  Off to hunt for a new full coverage option for the days that's what I want. SHAME on you Lancome for changing an enduring and pretty perfect product.

I have drier skin, and the formula felt a bit too thick. Instead of giving me a smooth finish, it emphasized every pore and clung to dry patches, even with a good primer underneath.

That said, I will give Lancôme credit where it's due. The shade range is excellent. I was able to find a really solid color match, which isn't always easy. I appreciate the inclusive selection.

One of the standout features for me is how weightless it feels on the skin, it's like wearing nothing, but with great medium to full build able coverage. The semi-matte finish is beautiful and looks so natural and smooth. 

I have oily skin so I wore it with the Hourglass Veil primer and was impressed with how well it held up throughout the day. Even when my natural oils started to come through in the evening, it didn't look greasy at all. Instead, it gave my skin a subtle dewy glow that looked fresh rather than shiny.

The only downside I noticed is with the shade range or the accuracy of the shades. When I first received it, I thought the color would be way too dark 345N , but it turned out to be a perfect summer match. Typically I would have picked a color in the 200N range considering I fall in the light skin tone range. To be honest, even for a summer shade I would have never gotten 345N which is for medium skin tone, assuming it would be far too dark. Usually for my summer shade I get a light medium shade. If I had picked it out myself based on what I usually go for, I probably would've ended up with something way too light. So definitely try it in person if you can.

Even on hot days, it doesn't slide off or fade. It also has a natural matte finish that looks smooth but not dry, so my skin looks polished but not shiny.

It's very easy to apply, whether I use a brush, sponge, or even my fingers. I just need a small amount to cover my whole face, so the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it worth the price.

If you are very oily I wouldn’t recommend it but if you are mildly or combo this would still probably be a good option.,54 CAD

This became my favourite foundation pretty quickly after trying and remained my top choice until my latest bottle. This foundation used to be much more mattifying and lasting 8-10+ hours, but with my latest bottle it no longer holds up nearly as well. I would call this a natural finish. The old formula did not require a powder in the deep winter, and this one absolutely does, and that's unheard of for me. This new formula requires powder basically always. I will be finishing what I have and will not repurchase as I want something more mattifying.",54 CAD

I got this during a sale and wasn’t expecting to really love it even though it’s a community favourite but I like it just as much as the Nars. It is full coverage but blends beautifully, it layers well and works with every product I’ve put over or under it. Once it’s set with powder it’s extremely resilient to any conditions. It’s got more of a skin like finish than the Nars I’d say and requires less of a skin prep regimen if you have dry skin. The shade range is excellent, too. I had to wear this foundation a few times before I decided I really love it, but it’s become one of my most reached for foundations. Fenty did a great job!

It goes on shockingly light but when it oxidizes it dries down to nearly a perfect match for my skin, but it's orange-y, which is typical for me. My undertone is very pink, and even now that many lines are carrying foundations in my shade range it's still really difficult to find something that isn't neutral/warm leaning. Since I bought this ages ago I also started using adapalene and I don't think there's any way I could use this without drying the heck out of my already-dry face. I think the formula is great if it works for your skin, and you test out the shade beforehand in-store, but if you are looking for a very light foundation with a genuinely cool undertone this isn't it.",54 CAD

I did valid slreasearch about the color and placed the order. It arrived very quickly packaged to a T and arrived very quickly. It isnt anywhere near as dark as it looked in the online photos and surprisingly matched my skin tone pretty well. Overall great experience and once i try the makeup out on my face and see how it is this could potentially be a repurchase:)!! My only say is be careful the shade you order online because if you are looking for darker the pictures on ulta arent acurate . Thats all,40 USD

I tried everything to attempt to like this foundation since it had such good reviews but it isnt good for anyone who has dry or acne prone skin at all.
