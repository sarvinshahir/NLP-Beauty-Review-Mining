Armani Luminous Foundation,"I love this foundation 😍ıt is look so fresh.ıt ıs ıdeal for day The perfect foundation for my dry skin, doesn't sink into my fine lines or pores, and has a very natural, hydrating finish (without making my face look shiny and greasy). I do really wish they would reformulate to remove parabens and butylphenyl methylpropional (which is banned in the EU and many countries) though. I’ve long struggled with dry skin, and no matter what foundation I used, it always settled into cracks. I thought I’d never find one that worked—until I tried this product. It leaves my skin beautifully smooth. A few years ago I would have loved this but I think it offers too much coverage and it’s quite liquidy; don’t love how it applies. I have dabbled with wrong shades of this foundation since 2016 but loved the formula so much that I kept using them by mixing shades. Finally finally found 6.0 which is a perfect match. this is , if not the best, it one of the top 3 foundations ever for me.. sucha beautiful finish. its medium to high coverage depending on how much u use yet its not cakey at all..it blends beautifully and great for someone with oily skin..it literally looks like ur skin but better.. it deosnt oxidize one me at all..i pair it with my huda beauty primer and both of them go great together.. it doesnt bother my rosacea.. everytime i use it i like mannnnn this is the best... even though i have troubled skin, i dont need more than half a pump to get my whole face done.. its very breathable and lightweight...its worht every penny Well I love the foundation but not enough color choices for us redheads This foundation has ruined all other foundations for me. Comes with a higher price tag but is WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Amazing coverage while complementing your natural skin. Shade range could be more diverse, but highly recommend trying this one out! A little sad because I love it and hate it at the same time. It has a such a natural skin like finish literally didn’t even look like I was wearing foundation, it blended well and coverage was great BUT I sweat a lot on my upper lip and nose. By the time I finished setting my face I had to go over my nose and upper lip because it instantly became patchy when I tried to blend it. After it was set, again, it was beautiful but within the next 30 minutes I was walking outside sweating on my upper lip and the foundation had completely come off by the time I made it 10 minutes down the road to my destination. :( I’m going to try it again when I have a less sweaty day lol maybe I have to try different powders and sprays when setting to see what works with it Absolutely baffled at the glowing reviews this always gets. Not spreadable, poor coverage (yet cake-y!) and terribly drying. Oh, smells it like latex paint. Not opposed to paying a lot of good makeup but this isn’t it! Worth every last penny! Never letting go. Just blends so beautifully on my dark skin and 0 oxidising this was my absolute favorite for years but they recently added shimmer to it and it’s also a lot thinner. It used to have a more medium coverage that was still glowy after being set, but not it looks cheap after being set because of the shimmer they added Very weightless and beautiful just not for me I sweat so easily and it would just pour down horrible leaving me like a wet painting This foundation blends nicely on the skin and gives a beautiful finish and coverage.  Even with medium coverage, it still feels light on the skin. Unfortunately for my wallet, it’s a great foundation. Medium coverage with a natural finish that lasts a decent about of time without separating. I didn’t want to love it this much. I went to the store to get the perfect color match as I’m planning to wear it for my wedding. I look flawless. So happy!!!

I For the price of this product and the reviews I really thought I’d love it, however it highlighted any crease I have. It also had a really strong smell I couldn’t get past every time I put it on. Had high hopes for this makeup but unfortunately unimpressed. Doesn’t go on smoothly over any moisturizer. I tried diff tones and it separates. But the end of the day it’s patchy. Just not for me. I have been using this foundation for many years. Every time I try something new, it is never as good. I always return to Armani Luminous Silk. It is good for dryer  skin plus it is not too shiny which isn’t flattering for older skin. This is not totally matte either. Just a beautiful natural ‘luminous’ look. The best!! First off, i am entirely frustrated that my shade has been sold out for MONTHS! However, because i can’t get this again, in my shade, i was forced to try and different brands, i tried Lancome foundation and i liked it much better and i noticed how flawed this Armani foundationis. This settles in my porse and globs up in my fine lines. I am 43 yrs old anc this made my skin look very aged. Perhaps if you have perfect skin it would be better.  In addition, this doesn’t last all day. Even if i yse primer, setting powder AND setting spray, it still easily wipes off after a few hours. I have to touch this up often. I am glad i was forced to switch. I don’t recommend this foundation. I was skeptical about this product because of the price, but OMG it truly is amazing. It feels so light on the skin and it’s not sticky or cakey at all. So smooth and looks so natural but is buildable! I was looking forward to trying this for months after seeing all the hype. I’m not sure if I got an old/bad bottle but I’m confused as to why people rave over this. First noticed the strong smell.. after applying it went on totally matte. I’m 37 and feel like it made my skin age as far as fine lines and pores. It was also very drying to my skin. I’ve had better results with drugstore foundations. Go to foundation since ive worn makeup literally wont wear anything else not for sensitive skin. after wearing for only a couple of hours, my skin was red and patchy. it wasn't also that luminous as they claim dries more to a natural finish. Nice on the skin at first. But way too dry for me. Shades also run too peachy for my liking. I love this foundation so much. It is the best one I have used. 
However, I am Color 5.1 and it is sold out everywhere! Have tried so many other brands to replace but can’t find anything close. Does anyone know why this is the case and if it is discontinued ?discontinued?
I Good product. Feel good on the skin. Very low coverage One of my 2 favorite foundations! Keep repurchasing for few years. Love how light and natural it is and at the same time providing a great coverage. Def a must! I have acne-prone, perioral dermatitis, and sensitive skin. I tried this product for about 15 minutes and my skin got super hot and my perioral dermatitis was getting irritated. It also felt like my skin couldn’t breathe. I am not sure if this was an allergic reaction, but my skin did not love it. I love this foundation so much, I am a normal to more dry skin type and it sits on my skin beautifully. I pair it with the saie baked setting powder and my skin is airbrushed baby! I’ve been using this foundation for weeks and I’m absolutely in love with how it looks on my skin. It blends perfectly with my light neutral tone, leaving a smooth, natural glow without any oily finish. The texture feels lightweight and comfortable — no tightness or dryness at all.

It gives medium coverage that evens out my skin beautifully, but still looks fresh and skin-like. The packaging feels luxurious and stays pristine even after months of use. Truly worth it — it’s the kind of foundation that makes your skin look effortlessly flawless. It sinks in really well on my dry skin. I don’t need to use a setting powder. The shade finder works really well, it’s the perfect shade! I’m TIRED of looking for foundations/concealers, I’ve wasted so much money and I thought this one might be it but no it’s waaay too dark. Why don’t foundations have light olive shades?! I’ve been using this for a long time. I’ve tried others just to see what else is out there, and i always end up returning. I can’t live without this foundation. This product is so light and last ALL DAY! Wroth every penny!!! I understand the rave with this product. Feels so lightweight and wears just like skin. Love the medium coverage and the satin finish without looking oily. 6.5 was the perfect skin match. I have oily skin, and unfortunately this didn’t work for me. I tried it for a few weeks, but my makeup never looked right, so I ended up giving it to my mom. I had high expectations, but it just doesn’t blend well for my skin type. absolutely amazing foundation, flawless natural look and was definitely the best foundation i’ve ever tried! i’m so upset i can’t use it anymore because it makes me break outtt armani if you see this review please make it non comodegenic this is not acne safe make it non comodegenic Anyone know when 5.1 is gonna be back in stock bc what the heck is going on I’ve used this product for 7 months. The color is perfect for me. It sits well on my textured skin and covers most of my redness and melasma. This is not full coverage but it’s a medium to light and blends so well. I will buy this over and over again. A splurge, for certain.  However, in my experience - it goes on beautifully.  The texture is buttery and silky.  Coverage is good and it's buildable.  It doesn't pill or crease.  It's long lasting.  A good primer, I used Supergoop, really helps. This is literally like your skin but better, it’s buildable, it’s not cakey and it works!! Love love! Will be repurchasing!! Might break you out of you’re acne prone but I find it to be so worth it, even then! I have been using this foundation for many years. Every time I try something new, it is never as good. I always return to Armani Luminous Silk. It is good for dryer  skin plus it is not too shiny which isn’t flattering for older skin. This is not totally matte either. Just a beautiful natural ‘luminous’ look. The best!! light weight with good amount of coverage blends nicely and good shade match just so expensive 😞 This is so lightweight I like that’s it’s a light to medium coverage something I was looking for. And the shade match perfectly Out of all the foundations I had swatched, this one was the one that matched my skin the best! If you need a light, natural-looking foundation, this is definitely your perfect match. I have been using this product for a little over a month, and I am so in love with it. I prefer a more natural and dewy finish to my makeup, and this foundation fulfills the things I wanted in a foundation. It gave me a beautiful glow that was almost natural. It also never feels or looks cakey. When I went out for the day, a lot of people complimented my skin and base for looking so effortless. Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation is truly the best face base product I've ever used! Regardless of my prep routine, this foundation gives me a flawless, filter-like finish that lasts all day. It sets beautifully, leaving a velvety smooth finish that's neither cakey nor dry. I love how it works seamlessly with every SPF I pair it with, allowing my skin to breathe while providing amazing wear. It's non-comedogenic, so I don't have to worry about clogged pores. In photos, it looks just as great as it does in person – no accentuating of pores or fine lines. This foundation truly feels like a 'skin filter in a bottle.' If you're looking for a foundation that delivers on all fronts, look no further – Armani's Luminous Silk is a game-changer! The most perfect, gorgeous shade match! I was truly so happy to have found the perfect foundation for my wedding. I'm planning to do my own make-up and this is exactly what I needed. This foundation is light to medium coverage and looks like SKIN. On a side note, I've only bought this for my wedding makeup and wouldn't necessarily purchase it for staple daily use as it's pretty expensive for the quantity (30ml). But for occasions, this will be my go-to! As a makeup artist I’ve tried so many foundations and always come back to this. It’s like second skin. Keeps you dewy & isn’t cakey. I always joke that it’s like the sister hood of the traveling foundation because I’ve tried my shade on so many different skin toned friends and it’s perfect. I do not understand the hype of this product. It is very light coverage and also doesn’t interact well with any of my other products. I’ve tried different primers, concealers, etc. And it doesn’t settle right with any of them. with any of them! I have been wanting to try this foundation for the longest time. It is velvety smooth and looks like 2nd skin. But I get the same results with Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation. For me this foundation works best if I mix it with Estée Lauder Double Wear. Otherwise I run out of Amani so quick that I’ll run bankrupt. But yes, great foundation but too expensive in my opinion. Armani Beauty 
Luminous Silk Natural Glow Foundation Such a shame that the best foundation ever created does not come in a fragrance free version. Many people can’t tolerate heavy perfume on their faces. I’ve seen so many people talk about it but Armani does not seem to care! nan There is a reason why this is one of the most used foundations by makeup artists. It IS luminous, it IS silky. 

However, it may not be for everyone. Anyone looking for full or matte coverage should look to others brands. If you are looking for light to medium coverage with a mildly radiant finish, thisi is the best. You can build it up but in my experience, no amount of building up will compare to a full coverage foundation. Best foundation!!! 
This foundation gives you a natural glow! Blends in very well. After working for 12hrs my foundation still looks greats. This has been a staple in my routine for years!! Everytime I wear it I get complimented on my complexion. Try it you won’t be disappointed! And the winner is...

Giorgio Armani luminous silk - color 5.75

I haven't worn foundation in decades. The closest I've gotten has been tinted moisturizer from Walmart. 

Well, my skin has changed a lot in the past 15 years. I will be turning 60 next year, and I have acute liver disease.  I need more coverage than I have in the past because liver health directly impacts skin condition. 

I had been having trouble selecting an appropriate foundation color. The online color quizzes always ask what foundation I am already using. That is useless in my situation. 

So, I purchased 4 foundations and saved up all of my freebies to color test at home.

Armani's luminous silk not only matched well, but it also has an appropriate amount of coverage.

Now, I just need to wait for it to be back in stock. This foundation is so sheer and provides no coverage even with layering. If your skin is good enough to just need this you don’t need makeup in the first place. Complete waste of money. It’s unfortunate because I had been looking forward to trying this for so long Great if you like almost a sheet coverage. Good for a no makeup makeup look. Not what I was expecting though I used to use this product when I was working.  It's a little expensive and I started using cheaper products when I retired.  You're never to old to learn ""if it's not broke don't fix it.""  So sad that Armani has passed away everything he did was always A+. I have been using Shade 5.2 for about 4 years now. It's Hard to beat the luminous natural look I get from this foundation.  I have dry skin, and this works great for me. I often get compliments when I wear it. I'm also a hard one to match shade, as I need something with a peach tone for a perfect match. “I love the Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation! It blends effortlessly, gives my skin a natural, radiant glow, and lasts all day without feeling heavy. Perfect for everyday use and special occasions.” Makes your skin look so glowy and beautiful, it is definitely not full coverage but it is buildable which is great! ethereal. it doesn't matter how many foundations I try I keep coming back for this one. it's beautiful. nothing conpares Every time I wore this foundation, I regretted it. I do not understand the hype. I felt like it weirdly settled into my pores, but also did not blend into my skin. It clung to and highlighted any dry patches, even if I wore a primer (and I tried several different ones.) will stick to my Dior glow And I’m definitely learning my lesson ￼￼ I finally got around to purchasing a bottle of this foundation and I did like the color selection that they had to offer off the bat. this is not at all what I expected it to be and it totally not worth the price and I hate to say this. it doesn't last long at all even with setting spray I had to reapply it at least three or four times throughout the entire day. the coverage is just okay the texture is a little bit silky but that doesn't last very long. I'm really sadly disappointed that I don't love this I really was hoping to. really not worth the high price, I'm so surprised!! I had high hopes for this one but it was a quick return. First off, It’s only 0.6 oz, unlike most foundations which are 1 oz. That was a little disappointing right off the bat with the price tag. It also requires a lot of product just to cover your face, and I’m not meaning to get full coverage. Just to get it on all of my face it required multiple pumps, which makes the small amount even more disappointing. It’s also very drying, oxidizes throughout the day and doesn’t last in spots you may touch throughout the day. It also caused me to break out. The only positive I had was that the color match was spot on. If you are looking for a daily foundation this is it. Not full more medium coverage for day to day looks. Does not look cakey or splits during the day. This foundation does look darker when applying. I will be purchasing my second bottle. Best foundation. Like skin. Just buy it. You won’t be disappointed. Worth every penny. I got a sample (few shades). I mixed #2 and #5.5. It matched me perfectly. I tried once, but I like it how it came out especially in the picture. I need to try it few more times with different skin prep Armani Beauty 
Luminous Silk Natural Glow Foundation My absolute favorite foundation. Literally melts into my skin and is perfect underneath the rest of my makeup. Gives me a dewy natural look! My all- time favourite foundation! It gives a beautiful, silky-smooth finish, I love it ❤️ I really wanted to love this prouct but after trying this with skin care and without skin care, I cannot seem to get this product to work for me. It settles into my pores and makes them look terrible. I typically do not have that issue with other foundations. There is not a Sephora close to me so I tried to use online shade match tools but I am not confident in that. The shade doesn't work for me...it looks kinda chalky. I am glad that so many people love this product but sad that it didn't work for me. I think I’ve finally found the one! This is hands down, the best foundation I have ever tried. Lasts all day, does nod settle into lines, and a perfect shade match. It is pricey, but worth it. I’ve used this foundation for over ten years. This past year the formulation has changed. I tried using with and without primers and good skin care, I am left with patchy and dry spots all over my face. Ugh. I have tried them all. I’ll be 40yo this fall and have spent so much money and time and this foundation is truly the best. Worth every penny. I have not tried to to wear sunblock underneath this foundation yet, but with just moisturizer this foundation is perfection. So so beautiful. Perfect for olive/neutral toned girlies! I would say this leans light-medium coverage but is buildable. Does crease on me after 5 hours but otherwise wears well during the day. I have very textured skin, as I have acne, scars, and pretty visible pores. I've been struggling for a long time to find a foundation that would sit on top of all of that (especially my acne, which is always super dry), and not look or feel gross. This foundation feels very light and isn't too greasy or oily, while still being hydrating and not clinging to any dryness. It doesn't emphasize my texture at all, and works for all of my skin, which is nice because I have combination skin. 

The only thing I don't love about this foundation is the fragrance, it would have been nice if it was unscented. I NEVER write reviews but love this so much that I feel I have to. I’m 45 and have pretty good skin. No acne and not much wrinkles. I like the nautural look. This did not oxidize. Didn’t settle into fine lines. Did not make me breakout. Doesn’t look heavy. I put it on at 7 am, work all day, workout, and it still looks natural with no caking. Very well worth the money. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Finally a foundation that does not feel like I am wearing a face on top of my face. I'm not usually a fan of liquid foundation, but this stuff is so light feeling on your skin with a satin finish.
It's buildsble, but if you want full coverage, maybe try something else.
Also, if you have very oily skin, you will need to set with a powder. The pump works well, and I like the look of the frosted glass bottle. Really wanted to like.  Says dewy and moist.  It's cakey and chalky and AWFUL.  Also, the color I chose came four shades lighter than pictured.  I am returning!!!!! This foundation had a really great shade to it, and it did have great pigmentation, however, it goes on so cakey and there are definitely better options out there, like Dior or Hauslabs First let me say WOW! I rarely ever purchase super luxury foundation but something told me to just try this since many brands are changing or, discontinuing products I see why many call this a staple brand it’s so good and lightweight I love it I did a color match at a store and brought home a sample to try before buying. I am gladthat I did because this got cakey very soon. Absolutely love this product!! Looks so good on and last. By far the best foundation I have ever used. Well worth the money Perfection. Bought to wear on vacation and was not disappointed.! Love this! Broke out with another brand so when my skin recovered I went into Sephora and it was suggested I try this! So glad I did! Matched perfectly to the number 5!  It’s pricey however I love it so much I will repurchase again and again! 
The Saie Talc free blushes sits beautifully on top of this foundation! This is a beautiful foundation that melts into my skin, and gives great coverage. Nice light-to-medium coverage. Evened my skin tone with (2x pump for full face), but still need concealer for breakouts. Will use as my bougie travel foundation for special occasions. The main reason for not giving 5 stars is the price point. Absolutely love this foundation. Applies like a dream. I have aging, dry skin and it works brilliantly — does not settle into lines at all. It’s light to medium coverage, but buildable. I apply with fingers, then use a beauty blender or brush to create a natural finish. LOVE THIS! I have had the hardest time finding a foundation that doesn't look orange or pink on me. But this foundation matches my skin perfectly. The beauty advisors really helped me find my right shade, we tried like 10 brands and shades an this was perfect. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is very light coverage and is not easy to build, like the description states it does. So just know before buying this that it is very light covarage. I’ve repurchased this so many times and always recommend this to my friends. I have dry skin and it looks great with the Armani primer underneath (or any dewy skincare). I’ll never use another foundation!! It's the only product that disappears into my skin; it's perfect!
The texture and color also completely conceal my pores. I'm in my 60's with dry mature skin. I've been wanting to purchase this for a while now and finally bit the bullet. I'm so happy I did. After using it for a couple of months, my sister now uses it, and I honestly get so many compliments on my skin. It's not heavy, but it makes your skin look its best without caking in fine lines and wrinkles, and I have them. I don't think I've ever purchased a foundation that LOVE this much. For the price I really expected to love it, but it's just ok IMHO.  The color match is great, but it's not really long wearing and it doesn't seem to pair well with any of my powders or primers. Estee Lauder Double Wear is cheaper, lasts longer, and seems to play well with other products. My favorite foundation ever, so natural and even! We buy over and over again I am one of those lucky people who have great skin. I live in Florida so the humidity adds oil to my skin, but thankfully I don’t deal with acne. After a few uses of this I noticed pimples under the skin all over. I can not recommend this product if you are more oily and I’m 40 so my skin looked textured with it too :( I have struggled finding the right foundation for as long as I have been wearing makeup. I have oily, textured skin with many deep acne scars. This foundation sits on my skin beautifully and blurs all of these imperfections. It wears well throughout the day with some blotting and  powder touch ups. No foundation will survive oily skin, unfortunately. But this is the best I've tried specifically for really textured skin with icepick acne scarring. this is my favorite glow foundation and I love the convenience of the travel size! I have been using luminous silk natural foundation for awhile. I love how it doesn't settle into my lines and looks so natural. the best! i have been using it for years. it is the perfect color for me, it goes on smoothly  and it covers just enough. Simply GORGEOUS. An indulgent sensation that creates a perfect canvas. I used Crema Nuda for years and am sorry to see it go. I ordered this as a replacement but found that ordering color #2 in Luminous Silk is NOT the same as #2 in Crema Nuda (#2 in Luminous Silk is more gold, in Crema Nuda it was more pink/grey.) I ordered another Luminous Silk (#3.75) which turns out to be a good color for me. I have actually been mixing the two Luminous Silk colors and that works well. I must add, however, that both of the Luminous Silk bottles have an odd chemical smell which was a bit of a jolt. I have noticed no irritation to my skin so it seems ok. I would buy this again. I purchased the luminous silk natural glow foundation based on other reviews, and this product exceeded my expectations. Now my daily go-to foundation choice for guaranteed beautiful, glowing skin, the buildable coverage lasts all day. I use it on all my actors , so pretty on the Actresses and light weight on the actors Great coverage and beautiful finish ! Love this foundation Gorgeous foundation.. it melts on my skin, and beautiful finish Color has been lightened slightly, but for the better! By far the best foundation I have ever used, buildable and glowy .No cakey effect,  Acne safe , the perfect option for acne prone skin since you can either wear a thin layer when skin is doing ok and build a stronger coverage when needed, try it you won't be disappointed ! I bought one for my mom and one for myself. We both love it. It doesnt cake or show your pores. It works perfectly on my skin. Happy with my purchase This is hands down the best makeup I have ever used. I have been wearing the luminous silk for over 10 Years and still LOVE it! Buy it. Favorite foundation - whenever I stray from this and try something new I regret it and return to this wonderful brand. This is the ONLY make-up brand I use.   I work in an Emrrcency Room sometimes up to 18 hours straight.  This foula stays flaess the entire time, does not shine nor settle into wrinkles.   I have spent a fortune trying to find the perfect foundation, and this it!!! My sister's makeup look great.  She recommended Luminous Silk.  We have good skin for older ladies but this makeup mixed with a drop of glow brings many compliments. Product is thinner than I expected and did not provide the proper coverage. Flawless coverage and so lightweight it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing foundation! I'm very pleased with this foundation. I don't wear makeup unless I have a special occasion. When I do, it's usually a skin tint. I have some weddings to attend this year and wanted a more professional foundation look. I wore this recently, and got compliments of my skin looking photo ready and perfect. That's exactly what I was going for. As for the product itself, it blends and stays beautifully. I love the finish on my skin! Beautiful finish, great for my dry skin. I can wear heavy moisturizer and serums underneath and it still sets well in my skin! looks like silky skin and hide imperfections. Stay all day This foundation gives me the medium coverage that I was looking for, and a very natural looking finish that last all day. Also, I like the fact that it is recommended for maturing skin with healthy ingredients. With the wide range of colors, I was able to easily find my match. I see why this foundation is rated very highly! I love this foundation it's medium to buildable coverage and it's very neutral on the skin. I always try different foundations.. but always come back! I break out easily but this one keeps me balanced . Matches perfectly to my skin. Blends out great! It is a fantastic product. It is light yet it does what it is supposed to do. It doesn't feel like I have anything on. It really is a must for a fresh natural look. I love it! Really smooth and beautiful coverage well matched and I would totally buy it again. I've bought this product 10 times already. I purchase it about every few months. It provides great coverage for the face, including all the big pores. Only small thing that I do not like is that my skin feels a bit dry! Other than that, it's great! I purchased this foundation after several people recommended it for maturing skin.  I like the consistency and how it sits on my skin but think I might need a shade darker as I still have to use concealer to cover imperfections.  However, it is better that the Clinique all in one I was using previously. When I run out, I will purchase the next shade darker (I am fair and started with the very fairest cool shade). I have fallen in love with this foundation again. I found this foundation when I was in my 20s. I am 42. I don't know why I stopped using it. It is very light. It is buildable. And it just makes my skin look flawless or airbrushed. It doesn't look cakey on my face. In fact, my husband says that it looks natural compared to the Dior Forever Glow foundation or the Shiseido Synchro Radiant foundation. Armani nails complexion products 100%. My go to perfect shade 6.5, love it.  Applies like a dream with a brush, sponge or fingers. Love this product! It went on so smooth! A must have! I read other reviews and thought I would give this a shot in the travel size and am so glad I did. Goes on smooth and does not crease in my wrinkles. Definitely will reorder. Give it a try ladies :) One cannot afford to leave behind your awesome foundation...even while traveling :)  Thank you for making this special size available. like the product. It's lightweight and it has a natural finish. This became my favorite foundation very quickly. Never tried to build up to full coverage but with 1-1/2 pumps (yes I can do a 1/2) I'm good to go for a medium coverage. It glides on so smooth like lotion and provides a radiant glow. For someone who's day always end at night, it is long wearing and doesn't feel tight so dry skin girlies— this is a winner! This foundation has played  very well with all of my skincare and other makeup (wet/dry). And best of all… the shade! Olive tones are becoming more inclusive in brands but the right shade to olive tone combo for darker complexions are pretty limited. My shade is 11 and it is absolutely perfect. Don't change anything about this formula! This foundation is the best, I have worn it for 20 years!! Nothing better than luminous silk foundation and concealer!!! I received a sample except I was reluctant to try it. I have extremely sensitive skin and Rosacea. The sample was good enough for me to use twice. It didn't bother me, and I liked that it felt lightweight. I bought myself a bottle even though I wish it didn't contain fragrance. So soft and doesn't dry out my skin. I didn't realize the last foundation was seriously drying me out. Love this Stuff Really impressed by the coverage, foundation lasts all day. Amazing! Best foundation out there. Light and natural but plenty of coverage I'm 57 with lots of little lines and hyperpigmentation.  This is light and beautiful. Please don't ever change the formula!! Goes on so nicely giving a flawless skin look. Foundation stays on all day. I have light skin with cool undertones. For most foundations, the pale shades have cool undertones but then when they get slightly darker and more to my shade, everything seems to go neutral or warm and look yellow or orange on me. This is the only foundation I can find my perfect match. The foundation itself perfectly blends into my skin and does not lean too glowy or too dry. This is my go to foundation! So flawless, light weight, and coverage is buildable This stuff is amazing! Best foundation I've ever used. best ever foundation that i used so far, super good So happy I found this foundation. So beautiful and natural looking yet enhances the look of your skin. Beautiful makeup !  Covers everything.  Would definitely recommend to anyone and I will order again. This foundation goes on like silk with a medium coverage which seems to last eight hours. This is the worlds best foundation! It definitely doesn't look like you're wearing anything on your skin! I have always hated liquid foundation until I found this. Please never ever, ever discontinue it! Goes on smoothly; leaves face feeling hydrated and covered - but not too heavy!  Nice glow. I bought this foundation 2 years ago to splurge for my wedding but I have never been able to use another foundation since. For every day wear I like a natural look and this is perfect for that. It blurs all imperfections without feeling too heavy or looking caked on like some other foundations. When I want more coverage I just layer on more and it gives the perfect full coverage look without being too heavy. I'm also acne prone and this never breaks me out which is a huge plus. It stays on all day doesn't smudge or crease. Great for my skin! Feels smooth and works great. I love  it!! This foundation is light and covers my redness beautifully. This color fits my skin perfectly. I have dry oily skin and it doesn't look cakey. There is a light scent. This is one of the best foundations on the market that is ruined by a very heavy perfume scent. If it weren't for the fragrance it would be my go to every day foundation as well as for several other women I know. The scent lingers and makes my eyes water which makes it impossible to wear every day. Also, fragrance in cosmetics that go on the face are terrible for skin. I know fragrance was common in foundations years ago but most of the newer formulas are fragrance free. Armani should really consider removing the fragrance from this otherwise beautiful foundation, I doubt anyone would miss it unless they like destroying their skin by putting heavy perfume on it. Overall, beautiful formula that is dated due to heavy perfume in it. I have Been using this foundation for the last couple of years. I love it because there are no makeup lines on my face  and glides on very easily. It is also noncomedogenic. Give it a try. Think you'll like it. Ɓest foundation there is, I am absolutely in love. It didn't go on as smooth as I thought it would based on reviews that I read online.  In fact, it was cakey and settled into the fine lines around my eyes making me look 10 years older.  I was very disappointed and wish that I would have stayed with my Chanel foundation.  Lesson learned. My favorite foundation that looks flawless on my skin. Blends nicely and evenly and the color is perfect for my fair complexion. I have tried them all, and I honestly find this foundation to be the best for the right coverage, and shine (just the right amount - not over the top).   I have a lot of redness and hyper-pigmentation, and it covers and looks natural.   Love this product. This is the best foundation out there. Well worth the price!!  It goes on smooth, especially when used with the GA Primer.  It doesn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles, and stays on all day!  I absolutely can't go without GA Silk Foundation! I love love love this makeup.  It leaves my skin nice and dewy.  It lasts all day.  Best foundation I've ever used. Color is easy to match too Perfection for my 63 year old complexion. Elegant, not heavy at all yet provides coverage where I need it--around my nose I have very sensitive skin, there's so many companies I've tried, but I have a reaction to it. I've been using Armani for a year and I haven't had any problems. Love the lightness of the makeup and the coverage. This foundation is great. Very good for mature skin. Sits on the skin beautifully Now I understand the hype! A little goes a long way and it photographed beautifully They best!!! I held out on buying this product because of the cost. In the long run it's a lot less expensive and than the 10 other lower cost foundations I just threw out!! One of the best foundations out there. Very skin like. Great medium coverage. Actually like the makeup but the black cap never fit very well. I didn't use the foundation often but the last time I did I picked it up by the top and the  black cap separated. The glass shattered on my countertop and makeup went everywhere. This makeup is great for mature skin. Flawless and glowing Really loving this foundation - it applies so easily and lasts the whole day! I purchased the travel size to try it first, will purchase the regular size later. the best foundation ever, I like a lot the precision in my face Although oily skin that breaks out easy with large pores this product is the best foundation for me. It doesn't make sense how it looks so good on my skin type. I am truly pleased with this product.  It is so light that you do not know you are wearing it.  It has great coverage without making my skin look aged.  It does not cause the wrinkles to be noticed. Wow.  This foundation is incredible.   I used a Btush to apply and it makes my skin look flawless. Does not look like you even have makeup—-just flawless skin! Goes on smooth and feels so light. Great coverage. Long lasting wear. Definitely not worth the price, this is light coverage, I consider it a liquid foundation, no luminosity and has a chalky dry feel, and a matt finish, not creamy, not a good foundation for pores.  Although I purchased in store with the help of a rep, in natural light the foundation shows in lighter in pours. One of my favorite makeup artist @joyadenuga works for the line so I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I was color matched by a really lovely young lady in the Short Hills Mall and found a perfect match that looks like skin. It's brown girl friendly lasts all day and looks so natural. I love the way this formula wears on my skin. I put it on around 6:30 am and take it off usually after 7 pm. It looks as good as it did in the morning. I am a big fan and the money is worth it!!!!!!! My new go to foundation, it lasts all day long and really evens out my skin to create a smooth canvas. Love this foundation. It goes on easy and stays all day. I have combination skin, and fair tone. The foundation works really well in the summer, it evens my skin stone. I was looking for new one from a long time! This is the best product. Works really good on my skin My absolute favorite foundation! It's so smooth and looks flawless on skin! I find it a great product, easy to apply and it matches my skin color Very silky, smooth and goes on very well. Perfect color match with full coverage and lightweight feel. I guess its okay. I didnt pick the correct color online so, to me, it was a waste of money. This foundation is the best for looking natural and glowing. People regularly remark about how lovely my skin looks. Without it I am a bit red and blotchy. Beautiful!!! Looks great on my 62 year old skin. Will definitely repurchase. Love the coverage that the luminous sill foundation provides. I struggle to find the right shade, but know eventually I will hone in on the right one. After reading so many wonderful reviews of this, I decided I needed to try it. I just love it. Excellent but light coverage (buildable, as they say), and by the end of the day, I dm amazed at how good my face still looks. I use with the Armani primer as well. Nice foundation that provides good skin-like coverage. Been using this foundation since it came out!

Love it but noticed a shad change… please FIX!

It's muddy darker than it used to be. This is about the closest I have come to finding my best color match in a foundation. Provides a great flawless finish, even when my skin is not at it's best. Please continue the promotions so I can keep re-buying this often! Doesn't line the creases... amazing coverage and light This is the perfect foundation I ever found for myself. If you are on the fence about this foundation, don't be!   Great coverage, perfect foundation! I can honestly say I don't even remember what my previous foundation was before Giorgio Armani. Love the finish, it smooths and blurs the pores. I get compliments about my skin and what more could I ask for than that. This is my favorite foundation.  It comes in a wide variety of colors and its usually hard for me to find a good color.  Love how it goes on and is not aging.",4.35,200
BYOMA Moisturizing Rich Cream,"Bought this moisturizer to add to my morning skincare routine skincare routine and it did not disappoint! It doesn't feel heavy going on, just super light and hydrating.
I'm loving this brand, my dry irritated eczema skin feeling so good from it. Currently using the Byoma Milky Toner, Eye Serum, and Retinol Oil. Definitely recommend! I've finally found my holy grail moisturizer!! Byoma Moisturizing Rich Cream has transformed my sensitive skin, quenching its thirst for hydration and soothing its irritability. Rich & non-greasy texture, absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling so soft. Keeps my skin hydrated for up to 24 hours, reducing dryness and irritation. What I love about it the most is, it has ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacin-amide which work synergistically to lock in the moisture, strengthen the skin barrier, and reduce inflammation. It is fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and gentle enough for even the most delicate complexions. 

@byoma Moisturizing Rich Cream has become an essential step in my daily skincare routine. It's the perfect complement to my gentle cleanser and serum, providing an intense dose of hydration and nourishment. Really recommend to everyone!!! 💕 After a long search i finally found a moisturizer which would not break the bank. It did not react to my acne prone sensitive skin at all. It is a rich moisturizer suitable for my dry-combo skin. Its so soft on my skin and protect my barrier cuz my barrier was not hood until i used byoma💞 Great product, great price. Can't beat it. Hydrates my very dry and sensitive skin. Normally, I have really dry skin, after using this, I don't remember what dry skin feels like anymore! It lasts long so you don't have to worry about replacing every week or two. I had to repurchase it after 2 months, maybe longer. I recently bought the Byoma Moisturizer and I'm so pleased with how it feels on my face. It's been 3 days and so far no skin reactions and feels smoother, softer and not dry. I like that I don't need to apply that much and there isn't a strong chemical smell like other moisturizer products I've used. It's not only affordable, but it's very hydrating and soothing to the skin. Never stinging unscented and absolutely the best it would be an absolute shame if shoppers stopped selling this. super thick and rich, didn't break me out, and layers well under makeup or for pm!! This product is amazing for my dry skin i'm obsessed! Such a great price too and I love the packaging! it was good but i like glowy skin and it kinda just made it soft and u cant tell really its ok i guess Bought for my teenage son who has struggled with mild eczema his whole life. The cold morning the are the WORST. Leaves his face smooth and balanced without clogging pores. Worth every penny! i love the texture and feel of this moisturizer! BYOMA is oneof my faveitie skincare brands on the market right now. Shea Butter is unfortunately a pore clogging ingredient for my acne-prone skin and its oretty high up on the ingredient list. However, this moisturizer is such a good texture and leaves the skin soft, plump & glowy. It would be perfect for someone with normal-dry skin that is not acne prone! Although it does cause tiny breakouts for me, I will still use it until I run out Leaves my face so soft and moisturized I love this. It doesnt pill on my skin which is other plus and i love how it makes my skin feel. So soft and hydrated. I used tgis in the winter and loved it once it got warmer i preferd a mote light weight one though. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily and have to be careful of what I use. I should have known better than to switch from my old faithful moisturizer. But I gave this a try and noticed blind pimples and deep acne within a couple of weeks. Wanted to love it but its just not for me. Seal had been broken, not much in bottle.  The cream itself seemed fine, but definitely used. i have combo sensitive dry skin. i love byoma products! i paired this moisturizer with the milky hydrating toner and the milky cleanser and love all 3! def apart of my daily skincare routine I lived in colorado for 4 years and would dread winter because i knew what would happen to my skin. No matter what i tried my face inevitably ended up dry, cracked, flaky, and sensitive around my chin. I tried so many different moisturizers, getting facials, slugging, exfoliants to get the dead skin off, and nothing helped. I'm not sure when i picked this up, but within a week my skin did a complete 180. I was trying another product at the time and stopped using this for a few days to determine which was helping and i very quickly found out it was this one. I've never looked back. The only con is the packaging. The pump can be annoying to get going, and also i wish it came in a bigger size! I love this byoma moisturizer so much!!! It works so good and is so soothing!!! I love this byoma moisturizer so much!!! It works so good and is so soothing!!! I love this byoma moisturizer so much!!! It works so good and is so soothing!!! This product is super hydrating for my skin while also not making it feel greasy and disgusting. It also doesn't break me out like my old moisturizer did. 100% would recommend!! recived this as a birthday gift and used it and my skins smoother then ever and my acne is gone! Leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and hydrated! Great for my sensitive skin ive been using this and other products from byoma for about a month and a half straight and i feel a difference and see the difference in my skin! My skin feels hydrating, its smooth and its also really good for skin prep before going in with makeup! 1000/10 recommend! I use this at night with the retinol oil serum and it works amazing.  my skin feels so hydrated with out feeling oily and greasy. I'm have been loving my byoma skincare. 100% recommend The rich moisturizer is so good! It makes my face very soft. The bottle is sleek and the pump works great. It does not have a scent. I would definitely reorder! I used this with the tri-ceramide serum & milky toner. It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth! The packaging is awful. The pump never pumped anything so I took it off and there was no straw attached to it at all. Now I have to smack the bottle on my palm to get anything to come out. Not worth the month since I can't get all the product out. The product itself is great. My skin was getting dry and patchy, and I stumbled upon this moisturizer. I decided to give it a shot and boy was that a good decision! In a matter of 3 days my skin went from dry to hydrated and plump! ❤️ I have sensitive combination skin, and this was just okay. I was expecting it be much more moisturizing than what it was, and it didnt really inprove my skin any. It didnt make it worse - so thats a plus - but there are definitley better moisturizers out there. Would really only recommend if you have fairly normal/unproblematic skin. I love this moisturizer! It's great at hydrating my aging, sensitive skin. It feels good when it goes on, and doesn't feel like it dries up quickly. 

My only complaint is the packaging. It's really hard to get all of the product out of the bottle, when you are near the end. 

But that won't stop me from purchasing again! These products came highly recommended by a biochemist on tiktok . This product is a great rich night time cream, i use it on the nights with and without retinol . I use the gel- cream  one in the morning and it gives me a glow. I have very sensitive skin no issues . Im very happy! When first trying this product i wasnt sure, only because i have super sensitive skin with pores that clog easily. Id had some breakouts that were healing literally from the night before. After waking up this morning. Ooooh weee. I love it. Redness has minimized and no oily residue. Great night moisterizer. I recently downloaded the Yuka app and this product rated very good. After trying it, I'm sold. It's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and moisturizes great. I'll buy it again. I am already on my 4th bottle The actual cream, imo, is comparable to Biossance's overnight cream at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, the container is absolutely infuriating. It's clunky and makes it impossible to get all of the product out. This is my teen daughter's favorite moisturizer. She loves it! I love this moisturizer! I needed something thicker for the winter tine and this product has been helpful. I sometimes get small dry patches on my cheek and this works. Makes my skin so soft and smooth. I am already on my 3rd bottle This reduced all my texture and made my skin so flawless! I love that it's not irritating at all and safe for sensitive and acne prone skin. Everything about this is 10/10. New holy grail. I really like this moisturizer it is really easy to blend into your face and it feels really hydrating This is a perfect moisturizer for my skin when it's really dry during the winter and the season changes. I love the not too creamy consistency and the excelent blend of hydrating ingredients to help repair my skin. I'm currently using it after my cerave moisturizing lotion at night for extra hydrates and glowy skin in the morning. I also have combinati on skin, but I've been using some prescribed products since february 2024. I have really sensitive skin but this is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't irritate it. It's light and moisturizing. Would recommend! I have very acne prone, sensitive skin. I can't even explain how much this product has helped my skin, and as a teen, this product is very affordable! I have repurchased this twice because it is very soothing and hydrating for irritated skin, and as a plus, the packaging is cute! This is a great choice for anyone with dry skin, compromised skin barrier, and mature skin. Amazing, buttery texture. It unfortunately made me break out though, I think due to the shea butter, which tends to be a pore clogger for me. I have very acne prone skin, normal-oily, so just didn't work for me. I love and ever since I stared using it my acne has been disappearing I bought this with the jelly cleanser and the brighting serum and I love all of byomas products slayyyy This is an amazing moisturizer! It's great for dry, sensitive skin! It's super hydrating! I love the packaging too! Great product! one of the best moisturizers I've ever tried doesn't pill great base for makeup and affordable I would recommend I order from Ulta quite often and this time was a little different.  Usually my products come in a box but this time they came packaged in a bubble mailer, which isn't the issue or a problem at all, I just noticed that was the first thing different. 
Second thing I noticed it came from the Return Center, which maybe I never paid attention to before but that for some reason stuck out to me.
Third, all my products came in perfect condition except for this one.  The top came off super easy as if the circle sticker seal on the right side of the bottle where the cap meets was already cut as if this had been tried out, returned and then re sold to me apparently.  This is just what I formed in my own opinion after opening my package.  Maybe I'm wrong, but as an avid consumer this was a different situation in my opinion and why was my seal already broken? I have the DRIEST skin due to psoriasis and eczema. Needed a new routine that I could afford and works. My skin is now not only buttery soft, but I haven't had a flare-up since switching. I have the Jelly Cleanser, Hydrating Toner, Hydrating Serum, Rich Cream, Barrier+ Treatment and Hydrating Recovery Oil. I use this moisturizer every morning and night and it is so good and I have been through a lot of bottles if this product and I love it I will definitely by this moisturizer again. This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. It is so soothing and moisturizing and doesnt make me break out! I was recently looking for a new moisturizer but nervous to try a new one because of my acne prone skin. i saw alot of recommendations for this one and ive been using it for about a month now. It is hydrating and DID NOT break me out so successful switch !! the packaging is so efective and I recoend for dry skin I was gifted by byoma and this moisturizer is amazing! I love how it's an AM/PM moisturizer. It's hydrating but not heavy on the skin compared to other rich creamy moisturizer. I like how it's an affordable price! The Byoma Rich Cream Moisturizer has quickly become a must-have in my skincare routine! Its texture is thick and creamy without feeling too heavy, making it perfect for locking in moisture and leaving my skin soft and hydrated all day. My skin tends to feel dry, especially during colder months, and this moisturizer has been a game-changer in keeping my face comfortable and balanced. Offered by Byoma: This product works so well for my dry/combo skin! I love that it can be used day/night and my glow is definitely still present in the morning and throughout the entire day. compact packaging is great too! I was gifted by Byoma. I love this product! I use it on my body when I'm going through bad dry spells. Also with the weather change this has come in handy very much so! I have sensitive skin and it also doesn't seem to cause any break outs Bakuchiol while safe for sensitive skin, it stimulates cell turnover as a gentler option to Retinol. So I have a hunch most people are using this daily if not 2x a day which I would def not recommend - that would explain all of the reviews highlighting breakouts. Start slow & steady, test patch & see how your skin reacts first. I enjoy this moisturizer & while it's hydrating at application, it does feel like it dries down pretty quickly after. I don't use it daily, but it's a good PM moisturizer option under an oil for improving skin texture and plumping. (gifted by Byoma in exchange for honest review) Truly have liked all the byoma products I've tried but this is definitely one of my favs! Thick enough for my dry skin but not too heavy. It's not greasy and absorbs well which I love. I also love that it's unscented. The packaging could be improved tho! Gifted by byoma This moisturizer has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine! I have very sensitive skin and this product never irritates or burns me. It's super hydrating and perfect now that we're entering colder months! I would definitely recommend everyone pick this up!! Gifted by byoma Gifted by Byoma. This cream is nothing special but it's inexpensive and so far hasn't broken me out. I love the packaging of Byoma products. This product isn't my favorite form the brand, I would recommend another (Gifted by BYOMA for review) I am a fan of this moisturizer and have previously used up a sample size. Despite it being a richer cream, I don't think it's too heavy for my combo-dry skin, even during the day. The texture is great. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I like that it's unscented. The only thing I don't love is the packaging. BYOMA packaging in general is bulky and hard to get the last bits out of. Would still fully recommend though! This cream has a thicker consistency but absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky which I love! Despite how moisturizing this cream is, it doesn't feel too heavy on the skin and it didn't leave me greasy at all. My skin felt moisturized and soft after using this. It is ideal for dry skin types or those needing some extra moisture. Gifted by Byoma This is a pretty good moisturizer especially considering the price, was a good product for my oily skin and kept my makeup looking smooth unlike other moisturizers that tend to separate my foundation and concealer. Product was gifted by Byoma. This is a nice moisturizer! I love the packaging and it's perfect for the winter time when my skin begins to get those dry patches. I would definitely recommend. My skin reacts well to it, and it doesn't make me break out. I received this product complimentary from Byoma. This is amazing!!! I love how hydrating the cream is it really saves my dry skin.

I love it and will repurchase over and over! I love this moisturizer! It's super thick and hydrating but doesn't leave my face feeling greasy! I also love that this moisturizer dries quickly and makes me face feeling greasy so hydrated all day long! Gifted by byoma My new night cream. Love how well it hydrates and wont break out my skin. Makes my skin feel soft and nourished. Gifted by Byoma! I love the consistency of this moisturizer because my skin has been really dry skin the weather got colder. It's gentle on my skin but really hydrating and I find that I can use this in the morning under makeup and at night with just one more pump. Perfect moisturizer before makeup it has such a soft light weight formula which is my fave for makeup application I also think it's a great summer moisturizer because it's not to heavy or greasy definitely recommend offered by byoma I received this item as gifted by byoma and to my surprise, it was amazing!!! The moisture is so creamy and rich that I put it on very last after all my other skincare. To perfectly hydrates my skin and leaves it so smooth and soft! I like this face moisturizer. It makes my skin feel good and hydrated it also does not break me out which is great because my skin is very sensitive. It is a heavier/ thicker cream compared to some but that's what i like about it since i do have dry skin. It's good to use morning and night. Good price too. Gifted by byoma Gifted by Byoma. At first pump I thought this was going to go on very thick but was pleasantly surprised when it didn't! It felt so lightweight on. It definitely kept my skin feeling hydrated for hours. I received this product complimentary from byoma. This was my first time trying a product from byoma, and I'm honestly shocked by how effective and beneficial this cream is at such an affordable price on top of being blown away by the education they provide about their formulas. This cream is fragrance free and has a thick, rich consistency that surprisingly melts into my skin quickly without stripping it or leaving it feeling heavy and weighed down. It immediately soothes my skin and deeply hydrates it while also softening it and providing restorative properties. It also protects and strengthens my barrier, leaving me with a healthy glowing appearance. I'm so surprised by how great this moisturizer is, and I definitely think it will be perfect for the cold months! This product was gifted to me by BYOMA! First of all, I love anything by this line.

I received this product complimentary from Byoma. This beautiful moisturizer sits so well during the transition from fall to winter weather. My skin is starting to feel drier and I feel this really helps with moisturizing without the grease for the AM and PM. My makeup lays well on top without worrying about flaking and my skin feels hydrated. This has become a daily moisturizer for me! It's affordable and keeps my skin hydrated. I have acne prone skin and this doesn't break my skin out at all! It's just what I needed in my routine for some extra moisture in these upcoming winter months. BYOMA gifted me this moisturizing rich cream and I like it so far. It is rich indeed and I have been applying it in the morning and evening. I like it that it is suitable for all skin types and color of the bottle. Love the way it feels. Gifted by byoma. I love this moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and feel like it doesn't irritate my skin at all. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, nourished and hydrated! I use this both in the morning and at night. Obsessed! Absolutely a favorite of mine. My skin is drenched in hydration when I use this. It sinks in so nicely and I'm left really nice and soft. This is also an incredible value and it performs just as well as, if not better than it's higher priced competitors, gifted by Byoma This is a very nice moisturizer with anti-aging properties and has a very affordable price and even though it says you can use during the day I think it was a a little bit irritating I would recommend using it only at night.

This Rich Cream Moisturizer has been fab! I am using it once a day during my night time routine, which also includes the BYOMA milky toner. My skin is loving this stuff. I do wish the container was larger, but regardless I will be rebuying. I received this complimentary from byoma. Gifted by byoma. BYOMA Moisturizing Rich Face Cream offers a rich, thick, yet non-tacky formula that deeply hydrates the skin. The creamy texture melts in effortlessly, leaving skin feeling soft and moisturized without any residue. I appreciate the Tri-Ceramide Complex, which supports the skin barrier, and the inclusion of bakuchiol and shea extracts, which nourish and soothe. The fact that it's alcohol- and fragrance-free makes it gentle on sensitive skin, and it's reassuring to know it's dermatologist tested. It's an excellent choice for daily hydration, especially for those seeking a barrier-supportive cream. Byoma is one of my skincare brands because they are very conscious about the ingredients that they use in the product. There isnt a lot of chemicals to my knowledge. This cream is super hydrating and I have pretty dry skin. It does the trick! Starting off I love how it shows you which step to use this moistening rich cream. I think the packing is super cute. As for the cream. It's not too thick of a moisturizer which I like but it is very moisturizing. My face felt so smooth after adding it to my routine. Definitely worth the money. My face has never felt more smooth or looked as hydrated. Gifted by byoma",4.7,110
Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,"Keeps coming back to this OG lotion. The only simple product my face needs after trying all viral products…lol It’s SO tiny, 10$ isn’t a lot of money but that little tube is not worth that much I love this product!! I use this a night and when I wake up my face is still moisturized! It is really good for dry skin. I will repurchase this for ever!! Classic face cream good for daily use no strong sent. I love this product, and the name ‘Dramatically Different Moisturizing’ truly lives up to its promise. one of the best moisturizers for combination acne pone skin Doesn’t absorb well and sits on the skin heavily 
Not a fan It’s such a classic and wonderful moisturizer. There’s nothing like it 😍 it’s my holy grail I have been trying this for years, since I was a teenager and now I’m in my 30s and purchase it for my teen daughter. She loved this moisturizer Good basic everyday lotion but it’s probably more worth it to go with drug store cerave over this. It does have an old lady smell to it but after using it for a while the smells “leaves”. I use it daily morning and night . It leaves my skin feeling great . Doesn’t feel heavy . Or feel weird . I’m a 32 year old female with dry/normal skin . This is my honest review.
I had dry skin in back 2019 and from then to now 2025 I have been using this moisturizer.This is glowy and perfect moisturizer for winter. In summer it is little oily.In the beginning I used to apply it and done beginning Ok ok product- i wouldn’t buy it again
Do not use more than 2 pump at a time.. it is impossible to massage it into your skin..
It does have some strange chemical smell to it.. i really prefer no smell Great product leaves face leaving face super soft great product I bought this product from a cruise so not Sephora but wanted to leave a good review somewhere for someone to see - I have dry sensitive prone to redness skin and I have tried so many skin moisturizers like Kiehls, aestura, la Roche posay, LANEIGE and none of them succeeded really my expectations (they’re good though).  I was hesitant to try this product because I thought it was gonna be another moisturizer I would waste and a lot of other Clinique products don’t agree with my skin but I love this one! I heard it’s a classic and my mom swears by it for her mature skin. I’m 29.  It doesn’t bother my occasional redness, I don’t get acne, it makes my skin feel really soft, it’s even fit for me to put on in the morning when I just splash water on my skin, doesn’t make my skin feel tight or any irritation and I love that it supports the skin barrier. The oils in the product surprisingly don’t bother my skin but beware - there are oils & petroleum which could clog pores. I believe I finally have found my moisturizer I’ll be using as a staple in my skincare routine. 10/10. Dry and sensitive skin? Don’t like fragrance? Like to use before bed and under makeup? This is perfect. I’ve used this for years and my skin is in great shape for a 65 yo. Doesn’t sting eyes. Listen to Grammy. This lotion was definitely moisturizing and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, it soaked in and wasn't greasy. Dermatologist-developed lotion is Clinique's best-selling face moisturizer. Silky, fast-absorbing moisturizing lotion delivers soothing hydration, rapidly strengthens the skin barrier, and replenishes skin’s oil-water balance for healthy skin.I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I tested the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+, and wow! Its silky texture absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated all day without feeling greasy.

With urea, glycerin, and pro-lipids, it boosts hydration and strengthens the skin barrier. The result? Soft, radiant, and comfortable skin.

Bonus: 100% fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and non-acnegenic. Perfect for my sensitive skin. I looooove this! you know why? Is so moisturizing, the emulsion feels likes butter ons skin, but because is for combination skin, is not heavy at all! like butter for smoothnesses but like clody or water on your skin!
thank you so jmuch to keep bringing good and clean ingredients for my skin <3 This is my everyday morning moisturizer.  I live in a hot, humid place and it's lightweight and not greasy.  I've been using this for years and have not found it's equal. Thank you @cliniquecanada and @topbox for the chance to try out this amazing moisturizer! Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion+ is a great every day moisturizer for my 49 year old somewhat sensitive face!

#cfs #chronicfatigue #cfsme #selfcare This moisturizer truly saved my skin. All other moisturizers I’ve tried recently have either caused me to break out or wasn’t moisturizing enough. It’s hydrating without feeling greasy or heavy, and it doesn’t clog my pores or cause breakouts! I’ve been using the Clinique Moisturizer during the colder months, and it’s made such a difference. It goes on really smooth, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day. I have dry, sensitive skin and love that it’s fragrance-free and doesn’t irritate. It also works well under makeup, which is a bonus. Definitely a solid go-to moisturizer for everyday use. 
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes The Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion is Clinique’s best selling face moisturizer and I’m so excited I got to try it for myself. The main ingredients pure urea, pure glycerin and pro-lipids help with hydration and supporting our skin in the best possible way. 

You just simply apply to your face twice daily, and it will absorb quickly into your skin. I love that it is fragrance free which is great for those more sensitive skin’s. It also adds reassurance as it is allergy tested and part of dermatologist guided solutions. 

I quite enjoyed this lotion and noticed my skin starting to feel healthier and hydrated. 

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. HOLY GRAIL for dry skin! This has been my savior of dry skin for over 10 years and nothing compares. I’ve tried so many other moisturizers and I promise you this is unlike any other. It might be the mineral oil that gives it an edge. Coul To be really honest I had high hopes for this moisturizer as it was clinically tested for dry to extremely dry skin by dermatologists but I was really disappointed when it didn’t provide that moisturizer even at home without any other factor interfering. It only lasted pretty well with a sunscreen when I went out which I think is not what a moisturizer for dry skin should do.

It should be able to act as thick layer of hydration without a reliance to another product. Another thing is it was oily sometimes or too dry sometimes. No in between which was frustrating for a moisturizer from a good brand. Personally I wouldn’t buy it.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I haven't used many clinique products, but have heard good things so I was excited to try this moisturizer. I have combination skin, but my nose gets very oily, and am very dry between my brows. I had hopes for this moisturizer, but overall it was very 'meh'. I tried it for two weeks in place of my regular moisturizer and it didn't overly make a huge impact. I like that it didn't leave a greasy residue, but it also didn't effectively keep my dry skin moisturized.

Formulée avec de l'urée pure et de la glycérine pure, elle renforce rapidement la barrière cutanée tout en apportant une hydratation intense. 

Oui, elle est assez épaisse et peut sembler un peu lourde au début – mais elle pénètre bien et laisse la peau douce, veloutée, et bien nourrie. 

Fini la sensation de tiraillement !

🌿Texture : Riche et soyeuse

🌿Absorption : Un peu lente mais super efficace

🌿Idéale pour : Peaux sèches à très sèches ou en manque d'hydratation

C’était mon premier produit Clinique – mais sûrement pas le dernier. it’s super lightweight and absorbs fast. My skin felt soft and hydrated all day without feeling greasy. I have dry-combo skin, and it worked really well under makeup too. I love that it’s fragrance-free, but I’d suggest doing a patch test—some people seem to react to it. Overall, it’s a solid everyday moisturizer! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. All my dry skin girlies hear me out!
This simple moisturizer fixed my barrier!!!!!
I tried the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ M Barrier Repair @cliniquecanada and it really works.
Been using it for a couple of weeks and it's just reliable.
Soaks in quick, no sticky feeling, and makes my skin feel soft and balanced - especially when my barrier needs help. Works under makeup or alone.
What's good about it:
Dermatologist tested
• Won't cause breakouts
Allergy tested
No fragrance
Sometimes you just need something basic that works.
No surprise this is Clinique's top-selling moisturizer!

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I have been using this product for a while and it has made my skin super hydrated and smooth. The texture is silky and the product absorbs into the skin quickly without you having any feeling that there’s any product on your skin. I have sensitive skin and this works wonders for me. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This is a great moisturizer especially for those with dry skin. It has a lovely lightweight texture that’s fast absorbing and it leaves your skin feel hydrated and moisturized. I like that there isn’t a strong fragrance and that the packaging is a container with a pump. This layers well with other skincare products and wears well under makeup too.  I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Ce classique de Clinique porte bien son nom. La Lotion Hydratante Tellement Différente est légère, soyeuse et pénètre rapidement dans la peau sans laisser de film gras. Conçue pour les peaux très sèches à mixtes, elle offre une hydratation durable et aide à renforcer la barrière d’hydratation de la peau. J’adore le format avec pompe – super pratique et propre. Sans parfum, douce, elle convient parfaitement sous le maquillage aussi. Un hydratant fiable à utiliser au quotidien, surtout pour les peaux sèches ou déshydratées !

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This is your skins daily dose of hydration, great for the harsh dry Canadian winter months. 

Developed by dermatologists, this silky, fast-absorbing lotion strengthens your skin barrier while replenishing its natural oil-water balance for that healthy, glowing look.

Gentle yet effective. 100% fragrance-free. Allergy tested. Non-acnegenic.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I received this product for free from Top box. I found that I did not need a lot when I applied this on my face. It comes out thinner but applies easy on your face. It helped with moisturizing my face. As an oily skinned and acne prone girly, I was amazed how Clinique moisturizing lotion+ worked for me during spring time. It probably helped that it was colder season when I used this since I have seen that this variant was intended for dry skin. 

I used it for over three weeks day and night. My makeup glided over it so well during the day and my skin felt quite hydrated during the night even with the heaters on Canadian spring. 
I am not sure if I am gonna use it during summer but I like how it can be still lightweight despite being ultra moisturising. I guess because of its ingredients like pure glycerin and pro-lipids that help keep the natural skin barrier. Clinique is always known for hypoallergenic skincare and this is one of their products that are free of parabens, pthalates and even fragrances. 


This is a good option to check this coming sephora sale for sure. 

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Spectacular! Give me 14 of them! This milky-like texture is formulated with Pure Urea to boost hydration, Pure Glycerin to bind and retain moisture and 3 Pro-Lipids that helps supports the skin barrier. My skin was feeling extra moisturized when applying this cream to my skin. It absorbs nicely once working it into your skin. I love that it's fragrance-free and doesn't feel heavy on my skin. It left a beautiful natural glow, leaving my skin feeling silky and look very healthy. 

I received this product for free from @topbox for testing and review purposes J'ai tester ce produit il y a très longtemps et je l'ai redecouvert, une très bonne crème, très hydratante Overall, I'm really impressed with Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+. If you're looking for a reliable, gentle moisturizer that delivers results, I highly recommend giving this one a try. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes.I've been using this lotion on my face for the past two weeks.i normally use it in the morning right after I shower. I like the consistency of the lotion, it is not thick nor is it too light. It goes on easily and does not leave your face greasy. My face feels moisturized for the whole day and I don't need to reapply throughout the day. The scent is light and barely noticeable. I like this because I don't like products with strong scents. I’ve used Clinique for years and loved the different products but this one just does not work for me. It feels like a cheap moisturizer and leaves me dry. I’ve been using the Clinique Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator for a few months now, and it’s honestly one of the best moisturizers I’ve tried. The gel-cream texture is super lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs really quickly into the skin, which is perfect for my combination skin type.

It provides a solid boost of hydration that lasts all day, and my skin feels plumper and more refreshed after each use. I also love that it doesn’t have a strong fragrance, which is great for sensitive skin.

The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price — it’s a bit on the expensive side. But overall, it’s worth it if you’re looking for a reliable, hydrating moisturizer that feels luxurious and really works. There is a reason why the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion has been a fan favourite for so many years, and it's because it works! I have been testing this moisturizer for the past 2 weeks. I use one pump, twice a day, on clean skin. I noticed my skin looks and feels smooth and plump all day. It wears well under makeup too. Overrated, cheap plastic bottle, smells like tires. Do not buy if you have skin on the dryer side. I live in west coast, which has mild summers and winters and this moisturizer was INEFFECTIVE during BOTH seasons. Somehow it brought out fine lines I didn’t know I had. Hydrating my skin has always been my skincare mantra, but ever since moving to Canada, my skin’s been drier than usual. I’ve been adding more hydration to my routine, and the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ has been a lovely addition.

I’ve been using it for a while now, and the first thing I noticed is how lightweight it feels. My skin absorbs it quickly, and thanks to its science magic (dermatologist-tested, fragrance-free, allergy-tested, and non-acnegenic), I haven’t had any breakouts.

Not to be confused with the Gel or Jelly, the Lotion+ is made for dry to very dry skin. While I haven’t seen any major changes, it does keep my skin hydrated and comfortable. I use it in the morning before sunscreen and again at night as the last step in my routine. It’s gentle, simple, and it works.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. J'adore le format, avec la pompe, il est facile à utiliser. La crème est douce et agréable sur la peau. Je l'ai utiliser matin et soir durant plusieurs jours et ma peau réagit bien. J'ai reçu ce produit gratuitement de topbox marketing pour le tester et faire un commentaire. i haven't used anything by Clinique in years and when i got the opportunity to try this, i didn't have high hopes as i haven't found their products useful in the past. however, i was pleasantly surprised as the product was extremely hydrating but did not leave my skin feeling slick or greasy. this winter has been particularly harsh on my skin and has been very very dry so this was just the hydration my skin needed. my face looked dewy and has been that way ever since! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes, however all opinions are my own!

Beautiful lightweight cream. It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly. Non-greasy finish. Silky smooth texture. Worked great at hydrating my combination skin. It pairs well with other products as it doesn't have any of its own additives. Every morning, I make it a point to apply this underneath my tinted sunscreen—it’s become an essential part of my routine! And at bedtime, I love incorporating it into my skincare regimen. It truly elevates my nightly ritual! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes and I found this moisturizer make a huge difference throughout the dry winters. My skin is so soft and I experienced no dryness or flakiness over the last month by I enjoyed using this product I used it day time and night before bed.  Its really silky and absorbes fast no greasy feeling.  I really like that its in a pump container makes it easier to control amount, only need a little amount to cover face and neck. It leaves my skin soft smooth Looking more hydrated  I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Review based on use for 2 plus weeks - I have a combination skin more on the oily side and I just loved the drama added to my skin from very first application of Clinique - Dramatically different Moisturising lotion.

It makes the skin look clear reduces blemish and gives a natural glowing look. 1 pump is enough to cover the face. It is light weight and fragrance free. Makes my skin look healthy and nourished.

This is now part of my skincare essentials for daily routine and I would restock it specially for winters.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes Love Love Love this moisturizer!!! It has amazing ingredients, absolutely no fragrance, and melts beautifully into the skin! I love wearing this underneath makeup and morning/night, it really is a tried and true favourite for a reason! I highly recommend ditching the extravagant packaging and fun names for a product like this one that actually works! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This product is absolutely wonderful. I've never had a product feel so light on my face. it absorbs very quickly and there's absolutely zero to little scent as well. highly recommend to those that are trying to add more moisture to their skin, especially into their face routine. I love this moisturizer! It works great on my sensitive skin. It actually reduced my skin texture (little bumps across my forehead) after a few days of use. And I was using a gentle moisturizer previously. A little goes a long way too, two pumps for my face and neck! Which considering the price I’m glad it will last me a while. 

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. It’s a reliable, no-frills moisturizer that works well for everyday use, especially if you have normal to slightly dry skin. However, if you're looking for something deeply nourishing or with anti-aging benefits, you may want to pair it with a richer cream or a hydrating serum. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I received this product for free from Top Box Marketing in exchange for my honest review.

The Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion is a great lightweight moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day. The texture is smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue, making it a perfect base under makeup. It works well for normal to dry skin, providing a healthy glow without feeling too heavy.

However, if you have very dry skin, you might need something more rich, especially during colder months. Also, while it does a great job at basic hydration, it doesn’t have additional skincare benefits like brightening or anti-aging properties.

Overall, it’s a solid everyday moisturizer that does what it promises—keeping skin hydrated and balanced. If you’re looking for a simple, effective lotion that won’t clog pores, this is a great option! Yo, this moisturizer is fire for sensitive skin. l've got that sensitive skin vibe where everything irritates me, but this stuff? Totally chill.
Texture & Feel: It's smooth, lightweight, and doesn't leave you greasy-just soft and hydrated all day.
Hydration: Keeps my skin moisturized without making it oily or too heavy. Feels fresh, not suffocated.
Gentleness: No irritation, no breakouts. It's hypoallergenic and fragrance-free, so no surprises.
Ingredients: Simple, clean, and soothing. No harsh chemicals-just calming stuff like aloe and chamomile.
Final Verdict: This moisturizer is legit. If you've got sensitive skin, this is your new go-to. 10/10
recommend! This product is for people with very dry, dry and dry combination skin concerns. This Dermatologist-developed lotion is Clinique’s #1 face moisturizer. This silky, fast-absorbing moisturizing lotion with pure urea and pure glycerin rapidly strengthen the skin barrier. 

Pure Urea is a humectant that occurs naturally in skin. It helps pull in water and bind moisture to skin to help keep it hydrated and balanced. 

Pure Glycerin is a powerful humectant that supports your skin’s natural moisture barrier by attracting moisture from the air and retaining water in skin to help keep skin hydrated. 

Pro-lipids help support the skin’s natural barrier.

Use it all over your face/neck twice daily or where needed. For best results use after cleansing and exfoliating. 

I have been using this moisturizer for a week morning and night and it is just ok. Yes, it does moisturize my dry skin but I have used others that feel and look better on my skin. It does pretty much sink into my skin right away and it gives me a nice glowing look. It is also non-greasy. My favourite part of this moisturizer is it is 100% fragrance free! I truly dislike fragrance in my skincare. It is available at most drugstore’s and other stores with a beauty department. As well as Clinique’s official website. It is also not overly expensive for the amount you get. 

I have tried and use other moisturizers that moisturize my dry skin better and last longer also I get a better glow. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I’ve been using Clinique’s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for a few weeks now, and I absolutely love it! I’ve been applying it both in the morning and at night, and it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated without being greasy.

My skin has felt more nourished and balanced since I started using it, and I’ve noticed fewer dry patches. It’s definitely a staple in my daily skincare routine now!  

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I’ve been looking to try out a new moisturizer recently to “broaden my horizons.” I’ve used other products and moisturizers before from Clinique that have always been fab, and this is yet another Clinique product that certainly does not disappoint. After just one use, my skin was noticeably and felt very hydrated, keeping my skin plump and soft all day long. The value for the amount is great, and you do not need to use a lot! I’ve tried using it for skin prep under makeup as well, and it’s continued to protect my skin without compromising the appearance of my makeup (for reference; i go full coverage, full glam). I would definitely get this again, and add it as a new staple in my skin care routine.

It keeps it moisturized and it’s great for daily use. It doesn’t have a smell and the bottle size is great for the price. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. After a few weeks of using this moisturizer I noticed that my skin felt more textured, dry, and patchy, compared to how my skin normally feels with my daily routine. On clean skin, I didn’t feel as hydrated as I normally do. Under makeup, I noticed that my typical base did not interact well with this. 

I’ve seen lots of positive reviews on this but I think I’m in the minority when I say this moisturizer just didn’t work for me. 

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Amazing product. So smooth on skin. Loved the texture Love this product! It’s a must have for your skin care routine. Unscented which is perfect for sensitive skin. Absorbs well and non greasy. It goes on smooth and blends in nicely. Has a light scent, not overwhelming. Light weight and moisturizing. Not greasy. Definitely plan on purchasing the other skin care that goes with this.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Been using this for a week now at night and am impressed. It leaves my skin feeling fresh while hydrated. It does not leave me feeling greasy which I really like. I have noticed my skin looking more clear and a bit brighter as well which I was not expecting!!
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This moisturizer is light, fast-absorbing, and very hydrating. It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and healthy without feeling greasy. A great choice for daily use! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This moisturizer provides instant hydration to my skin but it didn’t keep my skin hydrated for long. It has good smell. I user it for couple of weeks but did not notice any visible difference. Also, it did not break out on my skin. Overall not that impressive to use it as my daily moisturizer. This moisturizer is light, fast-absorbing, and very hydrating. It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and healthy without feeling greasy. A great choice for daily use! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes but I've used different iterations of this moisturizer for years. I remember first trying it as a part of Clinique's suggested skincare routine when I was much younger and now that my skin is more mature and dehydrated, I wasn't sure that this would work the same. This formula claims to repair the skin barrier which really intrigued me. it definitely hydrates without leaving a greasy feeling as it quickly absorbs into the skin. I usually have to put on a thick layer of moisturizer for it to last me throughout the day but I did not need to do that with this one. There were no dry patches that appeared and my skin didn't feel uncomfortable tight with wear time. This formula is also fragrance free so it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+™ for some time now, and overall, it's a great everyday moisturizer, especially for those with normal to dry skin. It has a lightweight, silky texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or heavy residue. My skin feels soft, smooth, and nourished after application, and I appreciate that it layers well under makeup without pilling.

One of the standout aspects of this moisturizer is its barrier-repairing properties. With continued use, I’ve noticed my skin feeling more resilient and balanced, which is a huge plus, especially in harsher weather conditions. I also love that it’s fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skin—no irritation or breakouts, which is sometimes a concern with richer creams.

That being said, while it does a good job of maintaining hydration throughout the day, I find that it’s not quite rich enough for extremely dry skin, especially in the winter months. If my skin is feeling extra parched, I usually have to layer it with a more intensive moisturizer or a hydrating serum to get the level of moisture I need.

Overall, this is a reliable, dermatologist-developed moisturizer that delivers consistent results. It’s a great staple for daily skincare routines, but if you're looking for deep, long-lasting hydration, you may need something a bit richer. Still, it's a solid choice for keeping the skin balanced and healthy!

Note: I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I have been using this product from past few weeks, it does provide some instant hydration to my skin but it does not keep my skin hydrated for long. It did not break out my skin though. Overall, I would not recommend this for very dry skin. I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin look so nice and dewy. It works great under makeup and leaves my skin feeling so silky smooth. I would definitely purchase in the future.  I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I have combination skin that can het quite dry around my cheeks during colder months but this lotion really helps balance things out. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue, which is a huge plus for me. My skin feels soft and hydrated throughout the day, and it layers well unfer makeup without pilling.

I was chuffed to have the opportunity to test and review the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + for Barrier Repair. 

You will notice a slightly perceptible scent that instantly dissipates after absorption. The creamy lotion is cool and refreshing. Your skin feels pampered as the moisturizing lotion penetrates with ease and is immediately absorbed. I noticed that you do not need a lot of this lotion to obtain positive results. The velvety soft smoothness is pleasurable. A lightweight formula dries to a flawless finish with no greasy or tacky residue. 


My skin feels deeply hydrated and moisturized all day long. The overall suppleness with a radiant glow is a boost of self-esteem. Skin indulgence after a harsh winter is a delightful luxury. My face is spring weather. I owe it all to the brilliant Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + for Barrier Repair.

I suggest that you purchase a bottle and see what this Clinique skincare gem can do for you. You will appreciate the thirst -quenching benefits that offer healthy looking skin.

You will think highly of the fact that this face skincare product is 100% #fragrancefree, #parabenfree, #phthalatefree and allergy tested.

Thank you @topbox and @clinique for gifting me this skincare lotion! 

#free #freeproduct #gotitfree #productreview #productreviewer #topbox #topboxcircle #clinique #cliniquecanada #cliniqueskincare #skincare This moisturizer is exactly what my skin needs to stay hydrated and plump feeling throughout the day. It applies super easily and doesn't have a greasy finish which is something that is really important to me. During the day my skin remains hydrated and dewy feeling meaning that I don't experience dryness like some other moisturizers. Since it's fragrance free, it also works great with my sensitive skin.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This moisturizing lotion is creamy, soft, and pleasant texture. Does not stick to the skin and melts instantly onto the face. The pump is very practical and of a suitable capacity, can be taken everywhere. It is perfectly suited for very dry to dry and combination skin as well. My skin regains its radiance, I wasn't expecting this amazing changes in one week only.
Guaranteed effects.
In addition, the Clinique dramatically different is 100%frangrance free and allergy tested. The ingredients are well-composed. I recommend this product for its quality, comfort, speed of effectiveness, and treatment time.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Ce produit N'hydrate pas vraiment ! J'ai l'impression qu'il reste juste sur ma peau et n'a aucun effet.

C'était extrêmement décevant. Je me suis dit que ce serait amusant de l'essayer pour voir s'il pouvait surpasser ma crème hydratante préférée. J'ai la peau sèche et Après l'application, environ 20 à 25 minutes plus tard, j'ai senti mon visage et le produit n'était pas absorbé, laissant mon visage collant et gras. J'ai utilisé la même quantité de produit que d'habitude (généralement 1, parfois 2 pressions), et j'ai été surprise du résultat. 

""I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I’ve been using this for a while as part of my skincare routine. It’s just a really good, simple and straightforward moisturizer—it hydrates well, isn’t greasy, and absorbs into my skin quickly. I also like that it’s fragrance-free, so there’s nothing overpowering or irritating. This is important to me, your face doesn't need to smell like anything! I use it morning and evening as a final step in my skincare routine.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I was having dryness on my face from the cold winter months, redness, and this product removed the dry and red skin within a couple days. I really enjoy the scent free aspect as well. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I recently tried the Clinique moisturizer and I'm honestly impressed. The texture is soft and non-greasy, and it blends into the skin effortlessly. It gives long-lasting hydration and leaves my skin feeling healthy and balanced. I also appreciate that it's fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skin. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable daily moisturizer. This is my all time favourite! Great package and value Why this product didn't come for gel moisturizer for this price makes my dry, flaky skin feel moisturized. works well under makeup as well. I have been using this product daily for years. Helps keep my sensitive skin hydrated! I am 53 and everyone tells me how great my skin looks and that I look way younger. I give credit to this lotion every time. I've been using it since I was 26 years old and it's awesome.  (also wear sunglasses and use sunscreen)  ;) The perfect lotion to repair skin barrier that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. My teenage daughter bought this and her skin looked so beautiful that I snuck in her room and tried it and have never looked back! This lightweight moisturizer is my tried and true. I just keep coming back to it every time I tet something different. Excellent product! Makes my skin feel soft and alive. This is my go to cream to hydrate my face for 10 years now. It's been a lifesaver, especially when traveling to dryer/colder places. Can't recommend enough! This is my favorite daily moisturizer. It goes on so smooth before my makeup. This is awesome! Only takes a little & my face is soft all day! I'm 64 & I was looking for something to keep my face feeling soft & hydrated, this is perfectt! It's been a while since I have used the Clinique moisturizer (I used it a lot in high school and college), but I wanted to try it again to see if works just as well used to. I'm happy to say it does its job! I will continue to use it! This consistently caused breakouts on my chin. Very hydrating, but i could only use it on my forehead without major red acne. I have used this product for years and love it. I use this product all the time.  I am so glad I was able to find this in a travel size. My sister recommended this product to me   Love it I use this product morning and night it is great I did not receive my free gift, not sure that I will order clinique again since this is the second time that this has happened. This is by far the best face moisturizer I have ever used!! I have extremely dry skin and this has helped me tremendously! I will buy this again and again! It last all day! Do yourself a favor and buy this!! You will not be disappointed! I bought this moisturizer because it was  on sale.  I'm not happy with the quality. It seems very cheap and does not have good moisturizing properties.  Not worth the money. I have used this for many years and will continue to use I never had a lotion that hydrates my face like this. I love it. This may be a lotion I buy over and over again . This all I can use on my face Great product the moisturizer keeps my face moisturizer and vibrant the entire day. My face looks beautiful and more natural! I  use this moisturizer year round. I have combination skin and this is perfect for me. It doesn't leave my skin greasy or oily. a new staple I ordered two lotions and they arrived without original packaging boxes, which makes me hard to trust if these are new items. I've been using this lotion for years and never had them without Clinique packaging when I ordered from Clinique. I went to a local store to request an exchange, and they said jumbo size does not come in boxes. However, I clearly remember that when I ordered a jumbo size from other stores including Clinique, I received it sealed and packaged in a box. This is my first time ordering through Ulta and I'm hugely disappointed. Have been using this moisturizer for many years and love it as much today as when I first started using it!  Keeps my face feeling smooth and hydrated and never feels heavy or greasy. I recall using Clinique brand starting skin care as a teen. Clean ingredients and easy three step process. The moisturizer is unmatched and a must overt the cetaphil brand Thanks I applied to my face & neck for 2 days, & broke out in a rash, didn't change anything else, still itchy after 5 days.. I checked the ingredients and noticed there is dyes in there.. my fault for not checking ingredients I guess. skin has been covered in red, itchy, burning rashes after two uses. had to go to the walk in urgent care for relief, skin is still extremely dry and itchy So i spent a week out west with my husband and if youve ever been out west you know how that the air and heat shrivel up the moisture content in your skin and turn you into a crepey corpse. Well it did for me haha i love this as a first step moisturizer before i go in with a second thicker one. This has urea wich is amazing for crepey skin! I have been using this moisturizer for years and still obsessed with it It does the job. I have dry skin and it does help moisturize but nothing significant to justify the price. It also has a strong chemical scent that I'm not a fan of. my skin is naturally very oily, but after trying this moisturizer, it really helped minimize the oiliness, and i love the results! if you have oily skin and want to control it, i highly recommend this product. i absolutely love it and will definitely be repurchasing! I've been using this moisturizer for over 30 years.  I still love it.  Super hydrating and very comforting for the skin.  I have very sensitive skin, and this has always been my go to moisturizer to ensure the best result with no reactions. So gentle yet so good. Softens my skin with one application Hydrating and sensetive does what it needs to do! 59 yrs old & just started using a few Clinique products. Love the face wash & moisturizer. The Even Better foundation is wonderful as well! Good for you skin routine. I thought I had oily skin, but turns out my skin was not moisturized enough and this product has saved the day! Has become part of my daily routine. I've had people tell me my face looks more clear since using this! My skin is much smoother and feels better overall. Found a huge bug leg in my Clinique facial lotion after using it for a month (top is sealed so it's been in there the whole time). So grossed out, can't keep using this product even tho it's one of my go-tos. And no way to report to Ulta or Clinique? I cant explain how great this product is! I swear it made my wrinkles less noticeable too! I love it so much. Not a fan. Lightweight moisturizer, but if you use it before your previous skincare product is fully absorbed/dry it'll smear white for quite a while.  Not thick for mature skin. Barely good for a foot lotion, but what else am I going to do with it? Ive been using this moisturizer for about 3 years, i use it in the morning my face glow so beautifully, i have dry skin, and i keep buying it, im 64 and dont look my age, thanks to this moisturizer to me is the best!!!! I came back to Clinique about two years ago and am loving several products including this moisturizer. Tried many other brands/options before I found tjis and now it's been my daily go to fot two years. It provides good moisture but doesn't pill, it's great under makeup. It provides the perfect amount of moisture year round. Love the larger size bottle as it provides goid value and reduces waste! I love this moisturizer! This is the only one that works for me, I have sensitive skin and eczema, and this is the only one my skin absorbs. If I go without using it, I'll have dry and flaky skin, but this will fix it within hours! I love this moisturizer! This is the only one that works for me, I have sensitive skin and eczema, and this is the only one my skin absorbs. If I go without using it, I'll have dry and flaky skin, but this will fix it within hours! As a 40 yo woman (medium dry skin) I have really madd an effort to find what works and stick to it. Its less expensive, but takes a good year to figure out. This has been a solid in my routine for years though. The price is great (and its usually on 21 days :) for the amount. And it really is a great moisturizer too. Husband lived it so thats one less product we have to buy. I love the nostalgia as well. Mom loved Clinique. I've tried numerous moisturizer for my face but nothing works as well as this. I have sinus issues with certain smells and this has known and few drops on your face goes long way . I have dry/oily skin works great don't change anything I got the whole Clinique set - toner, face wash, lotion, everything - in June and am still trying to repair the damage today. The products caused serious cystic acne, milia, whiteheads, blackheads, and excessive oil production. Would not recommend. To all those bad comments i just read through, you obviously have DRY skin that isn't acne prone so i am not really sure why you even bought this product? its not targeted towards dry skin what so ever. It's specifically a GEL formula for acne prone skin because moisturizer can make us feel greasy, we need a moisturizer that is drying but also hydrates without irritating our skin barrier plus we have lots of oil being pushed through our oil glands hence why we are so acne prone. Please do some actual research before you leave a bad review for a product that doesn't even cater to you !!! anyways. I love this moisturizer i use the whole acne three step line and i have oily/combination skin ! definitely try to get all the products together and use them consistently i used everything once a day for awhile until my skin built some sort of tolerance i suggest you do the same if your skin is very prone to drying. especially if you're using this entire line with the cleanser and exfoliating lotion. These products are for real ACNE. not a little white head from here and there so please do not waste your money on a product that isn't made for you there are a million other products that DO cater to you. More specificfly if you have clear skin , why are you buying this? you should not be using this if you aren't acne prone at all. Don't dis encourage others just because you literally bought a product that's made for oily skin. I will 100% repurchase this once i'm finished this is going to be such a good moisturizer for the summer i'm very happy with my purchases:3 bought for my teen daughter for acne prone skin. Feels nice on my face but not heavy. Very moisturizing. I have used this product for years and will continue to use it. .Good product!! Returned, Moisture Surge is far better with my skin Fells like you have a residue on your skin. I have used this moisturizer since my teens, so since the 90's. Recently I decided to go back to my favorite which was Dramatically Different since nothing compared over the last few years and now live in a desert climate. What on earth happened, Clinique? Even small spot applications pill up. My skin gets dermaplaning so it is not absorbing right, and where it apparently did caused nothing but breakouts. I never would have dreamed a Clinique staple like this would cause a breakout. Even tried a tiny amount as a barrier for a hike and felt like a grease pit was on my face. I love tge clinique moisturesurge but this was a let down. After applying to my dry spots it absorbed quickly left my skin feeling EVEN DRYER. My eyes also dtarted to burn and it was put nowhere near them. I love tge clinique moisturesurge but this was a let down. After applying to my dry spots it absorbed quickly left my skin feeling EVEN DRYER. My eyes also dtarted to burn and it was put nowhere near them. It's awesome! It makes my skin feel amazing I've been using this product since 1975. it works as great as ever!! This does just what it says it will - softens and moisturizes. Like the pump and the amount of moisturizer that comes out. I love this moisturizer! I have eczema and at 55 years old I have tried many different products. This has been the best facial moisturizer I have found. It absorbs quick enough to apply powder foundation pretty immediately. It keeps my face moisturized all day, especially useful during dry winter months. I love this moisturizer! I have eczema and at 55 years old I have tried many different products. This has been the best facial moisturizer I have found. It absorbs quick enough to apply powder foundation pretty immediately. It keeps my face moisturized all day, especially useful during dry winter months. Best hydration This is my go to, all time favorite everyday facial moisturizer!  Never disappoints. The product is great! However; the size is smaller than a trial size and is not worth the money. It's smaller than the size of the product in their gift with purchase. If you need Dramatically Different Lotion, buy the full size and put it in a travel container. I just want to start off by saying that I have not been able to try this lotion long-term as I really wish I could. It is such a shame because the lotion felt really nice on my face and really promising, but as soon as I looked at the back of ingredients, and I noticed it had ingredients like artificial dyes such as yellow, red, and mineral oil, I had to put it down. I have been on a recent health conscious wellness journey that includes the product that I put on my skin/hair, so I have been opting for products that don't include fragrance or artificial dyes, mineral, oil, pathlates etc., and are more on the clean side. Artificial dyes are very disruptive to our health. I would much rather slather a product that doesnt have an ""aesthetic"" color or fragrance, but that I know will be super beneficial to my skin and overall health. It is not worth it to me to spend almost $40 on a skincare product that will not be mindful of the negative impact of its ingredients. I hope others can also be more conscious of their products as this will be beneficial long term to your health. That being said, I appreciate other clinique products that are afyuakly on the cleaner side. Thank you. I have been using this moisturizer since my early 20's and I am 60 now.  It makes my skin look and feel smooth, soft and vibrant.  I get so many compliments from people saying, ""wow you have really nice looking skin"", ""younger looking"".

It is not sticky or heavy feeling.  I recommend this to everyone. This makes my makeup with cakey. I have better results with inexpensive moisturizers. In my opinion not worth the money. I can't complain about this moisturizer. It hydrates my face and last until I was it off. It's non greasy. I've been using this for years. Smells so bad, greasy, broke me out. Made my makeup separate. Doesn't moisturize skin. ♡♡♡ It's the BEST nighttime moisturizer I've ever tried! I'm 48, and am still very acne prone. so many other creams break me out, but this one doesn't. I've tried many other brands, but they either didn't moisturize enough, broke me out, and/or would pill up with my tret cream. But Clinique doesn't. I'm finally waking up dewy and refreshed. It's my new HG product! 

(note: there are two formulas that look really similar. I'm referring to their original moisturizing lotion, NOT the gel.) It didn't break me out, but it also didn't absorb well. Since retiring I've not been able to buy Clinique but I've returned to using it & I'm so happy with this lotion. I love it, gentle your face Need a better moisturizer My mom has been using it for years and recommended. I try. I love it. I have used this for years! I will never try anything else! I love this product and use it daily. highly recommend! I love this product. Extremely drying for mature skin. My partner would not commit to using any face lotion until this one, he's been using it everyday and LOVES it. He will never use anything else. I got this because I received a small sample that I really liked. Liked this at first but after a week I noticed it sucked all the oil from my face. I now have large dry patches all over and it just feels irritated. Feels like I wasted my money. Great for the price, especially since I got it on sale. My skin seems to be more on the normal/dry side and this moisturizer works well for me. I've mostly been using it every morning and night in the summer so far, but it absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling the right amount of moisture, not dry. I'm glad I decided to give it a try. I used this for years and I loved it would be the only lotion very select a few that I can use this Neutrogena Hydro boost and Aveeno daily moisturizer are the only creams I've ever used that I don't break up with this unfortunately made me break out after two uses This product helped my teenage acne and now is my go to for senior dry skin! This is one of the few moisturizers that keeps my skin healthy without breakouts/hives. I have very sensitive skin and can't use a whole lot of brands. My hands get very chapped in the winter and other lotions sting when I try to fix it. But I put this lotion on, absolutely no pain and it cleared up immediately! I now use it daily on my face and I see a difference! Could not recommend it more! I was using neutrogena hydroboost & it worked so well for me. I ran out & ended up at ulta & wanted to try this since my sister was using it. It caused me to breakout, i had 3 huge pimples & my face is almost always clear. I have combination skin type & i do have sensitive skin. If you are similar to me use neutrogena hydroboost it is the best & cheaper! Feels like it struggles to sink into my skin and the texture isn't as nice as other moisturizers I've used. I think there are better options out there. This product helped my 60+ years skin immensely. Recently my skin became very flaky even though I hadn't changed my skin care routine. I replaced my moisturizer with this product and within days the problem was resolved. My skin is MUCH better. I use this morning and night and my skin has never been better. Thank you Clinique. This moisturizer is worth every penny for me, and i have sensitive skin! I love how thick it feels on my face but light weight at the same time. I use this at night to secure my glow in the morning! I havent had any problems and i personally likd the smell actually. I wish the body moisturizer or hand ones were cheaper or I would own all of them! And plus the color is super cute! This is the only lotion that I can use daily that won't break me out or cause irritation. We use this every day , have been using this for years.. I LOVE this! One of the best all times OG products! Great for all skin types. This is the best Got this on sale and it is really nice It's not good nor bad, but at least it doesn't cause acne, I use it as a primer, it makes the foundation matte, and doesn't crease. Honestly I won't buy again. It's just ok I just bought this for the sale and my face has literally never been softer. I was struggling with dry patches all over my face and I put this lotion on and im not kidding that dryness hasnt come back. that was two days ago ! The way this works so fast and makes your face so smooth, I really didnt believe it at first. Very good moisturizer 10/10 recommend! (I see complaints about the smell, but I love that they dont add fragrance. my sensitive skin does not mix well with fragrance so I can deal with it) I break out within 2-4 hours with small tiny whitehead type blisters on chest, cheeks, forehead, and/ or chin, I do not get breakouts nor do I have acne prone skin otherwise, it works well, I just avoid those areas and use Murad for majority of my skin care and have for 30+ years. This works wonders on feets, hands, elbows, and other dry areas / skin. I have tried many many moisturizers and this is my favorite one by far. A little bit goes a long way and it makes my skin look and feel great all day. It's great for my dry & sensitive skin. I don't understand the hype for this product.   It was...okay.   I really dislike the smell.   Plus it's very thin.   It was gentle, which I appreciate because my skin can be sensitive.   However, it doesn't moisturize nearly as effectively as other products out there.   I often need to use more than one application, which I don't find with other products, even drug store brands.  Plus it didn't fully absorb into my skin and left a shiny kind of film.  I am glad I got it half off, I'd never pay full price.  I will not repurchase. I've used so many moisturizers but this one is the best I've used. I've been using it for 4 years now and my skin loves it. I tried using other ones but my skin didn't like them as much as this one. If you have sensitive skin I recommend this one.",4.20952380952381,210
Dior Forever Skin Glow,"Nice hydrating foundation. A thin layer goes a long way, you can build it up but I feel it looks best applied really thinly with a brush. i have tried it with a beauty blender and it felt too heavy on my face. As someone with combination skin I do find I have to set with a loose powder in the oiler areas of my face. I use milk hydro grip underneath and set with Laura Mercier loose powder and urban decay all nighter spray. It doesn't move and doesn't separate all day. One thing to keep in mind when choosing your shade; it DOES OXIDIZE, at least on MY skin, I know everyone has different skin chemistry, so this may not be the case for everyone. I ended up going back and buying a shade lighter than what I first bought. I would recommend swatching on your neck or hand and shop around 20 min or so and see if the colour will oxidize on you too. Other than the oxidizing thing I really love it. It's pricey... but honestly one bottle lasts literally forever. As someone who does not wear makeup often, this foundation is very easy to apply and blend. Provides moderate dewy coverage. I love this foundation so much!! I struggle to find nice foundations and have spent way too much money. It is beautiful, natural looking and a little goes a long way! The only downside is that the shades are tough to match. I would say I have light to medium skin, but this shade was even too dark for me. I am like a shade 2 lol! It also does oxidize so will turn a bit darker after you apply. I would just test out the shades. Love the foundation though and it doesn’t make my combo skin break out or anything. Also has pretty clean ingredients. Love it!! Really good Dior hydration foundation but it’s not matching my skin tone Beat foundation ever pricey but worth it. Will continue to buy it. they sold items used before never buy online items again I was colour matched in the store, but I thought it smelt funny when she was putting it on. I bought one anyways and took it home only to pull it out that evening and see it has been expired for over a year. My skin is already breaking out from having it on my skin from the store. Not to mention it clings to any fine lines. WOW.  Great coverage but doesn't look ""cakey"" at all.  A little goes a long long way.  Love the hydrating too.  I usually can't wait to finish work and take  makeup off.Not now.  Great long wear and stays fresh looking.This is so my new foundation.As usual CD didn't disappoint. All makeup I now use is Dior.  Totally boss. I think I may have found my holy grail foundation! It was a long struggle as I was deciding between lancome teint idol, dior forever skin glow/matte or haus lab foundation.  I first bought lancome, it was alright but I wasn't loving it and for the price I should be loving it, so I went back and exchanged it for dior. 

I usually go for matte cause i like a soft blur effect (especially around the pores).  Although I always wanted a radiant finish too, I was worried it would look oily or emphasize my texture and pores. However, based on my various research (youtube video), many reported the matte and skin glow version bring similar with slight difference in finish. With the weather getting colder, i do want my skin to be more hydrated, so i got skin glow, and im loving it. It has a slight satin effect at first, especially with powder. The glow becomes more apparent over time, but it won't look oily but actually more skin like with a healthy hydrated look. It's still transfer proof and longevity it good too. By the 9h work, it started to separate but only a little, and it's very easy to fix up without it affecting the rest of the face.

I actually compared it with haus lab (i got a sample) cause I heard great things about it, and i really love how haus lab looked on my hand when I was swatch both in the store. It was smoother and more radiant than dior but also seems it would transfer more. When trying both on with powder, the transfer is no longer an issue. Interestingly, at first, haus lab looked more radiant AND powdery than dior, which looks soft and skin like. But after a while, both looked skin like but haus lab did settle into my pores a bit more. It also doesn't last as long as dior, since it started breaking apart around the 7h mark, but like dior it's easy to fix up without it affecting rest of the face. Absolutely loving it. It gives such a smooth and satin finish, gives decent coverage without being cakey at all. I have normal to dry skin, and this does not oxidize on me. I find it to be the same shade after many hours. I will say try the shade in store though because I usually use warm, but this foundation I use neutral. Shout out to Paula for helping me shade match. My skin is dry so it's difficult to me to find a foundation which not make it's cakey. One of the staff showed me this foundation 3 years ago and I just keep using it until now. I don't need to use powder but itself keep long on my face Best foundation ever! The color is perfect, leaves no steaks, blends in wonderfully! 
Smells great too nan This foundation is the best I’ve tried so far. For DRY SKIN, this is excellent. It’s super hydrating and I swear it makes your skin look more radiant after each use. It’s like skincare + makeup, it’s amazing!!! The Dior Forever Skin Foundation was a disappointment. It felt overly oily on my skin, oxidized significantly throughout the day, and the strong fragrance irritated my sensitive skin, leading to breakouts. Not suitable for Worn this a couple times but noticed it left my face really oil and caused breakouts. This foundation oxidizes. This foundation blends perfectly and makes your skin hydrated! Went on smoothly and had a beautiful, gentle, glowy finish. But I don't have a shade.  00N is too yellow and too light.  0CR is too deep. I literally tried so many foundation but this is best the best foundation ,, i am glad that i found my correct shade , it is very dewy ,long lasting . I love to recommend this . i’ve been using this for about a month, and i hate to say it but it’s my new fave foundation! the ONE thing i hate about this is the fragrance in it (literally what is the point of FRAGRANCE in a FOUNDATION?) i have VERY acne prone/textured skin and i haven’t noticed any extra texture since using this, but i would be cautious if you’re sensitive to fragrance on skin. in terms of coverage, i would say it’s medium, but can be built up. i was originally really worried because im on arazlo, and every single foundation/tint i’ve used since starting it literally PEELS off my face after like an hour, but this foundation looks soooo smooth on my skin, and holds up until the end of my shifts! so far the only foundations to work on my skin since arazlo are this one and the lancôme glow foundation. overall, just a really nice foundation that sits so nicely on my TEXTURED skin!! BOMB BOMB BOMB I am obsessed. Perfect balance between sheer and medium coverage. Depending on how I feel and the look I want that day, I often just wear this as my base after moisturizer and primer and then add a little more under my eyes and-boom, perfect. Not only does it FEEL light, it hydrates dull skin without leaving a greasy film. My skin looks radiant and Dior Forever Skin Glow Hydrating Foundation has become a STAPLE in my makeup routine. 

OH BUT BEWARE — TEST THESE SHADES IN PERSON AT A STORE. Their naming system is very off (at least I found it to be). 

For some background, I have always been neutral toned, I have both green and blue veins in my arms and am a darn-near greenish yellow-olive undertone to my skin and go brown in the summer (no red, no pink, just golden brown). I spent over an HOUR testing all the different shades and tones and finally came to 0W. It is my EXACT match right now, however, it’ll be a different story when my skin sees the sun. Highly highly recommend going IN STORE and trying all of the shades because I never would have guessed I’d be “warm”. I'm in my mid forties and I really like this.  I don't need full coverage so medium coverage is good for me.  Keeps my skin looking hydrated, lasts all day, and looks amazing.  I need only one pump which is a small amount but it does the job. Used to rave about this foundation even though It oxidizes, I loved It, just knew to get a shade lighter. Until It started to give me the WORST texture bumps everywhere because of the fragrance In It. Best foundation, gives such a natural glow. The coverage is perfect, I have a little scar I usually test foundation over to see if it can give me the coverage and if I apply it a few times in that area it definitely does. I even returned my ester lauder double wear for this and I’ll never go back. This foundation DOES oxidize - but it’s my absolute favourite foundation. I’m a true combo skin girly, and during the winter get eczema under my eyes. It feels great on my skin and doesn’t look heavy even when you build it up to super full coverage, on a day to day I can achieve a light to medium coverage with it and it lasts the whole day. 

It isn’t transfer-proof but the way my skin looks and feels so healthy and glowy but not oily is perfect. There’s no weird clinging to dry patches, or separation due to oil. I really enjoy this foundation and highly recommend it just keep in mind it does oxidize when you’re shade matching! My bad, I tried the hydrating one but it is too shiny and it transfers a lot. The coverage is good though. Natural, lightweight, mid to high coverage. She is THAT girl, she is the moment. I don’t even feel it on my skin, yet it is sooo beautiful 🥰🥰🥰. The glass packaging is slick and elegant. It’s ok! I found it wasn’t as hydrating at others as well as it settles and shows pores. I am mixing it now with my Givenchy and like it that way for more flawless/skin like effect I bought this for the first time cuz the brand i was using was out of stock, and I found this one is even better than the one i was using I was going to try this after seeing many wonderful reviews here and on Youtube. OMG people, the SECOND ingredient after water is ALCOHOL. And Dior has the gall to call this a “clean product”. Alcohol causes skin cell death. It is a very destructive ingredient for skin. And it is the second most abundant ingredient in this foundation. No way am I going to put this swill on my face. long-lasting and resistant to heat and humidity, making it ideal for all-day wear. Not 100% a fan. Hydration is definitely there. Just not a fan of how easily if transfers to fabric or even my hands. I bought this from the store yesterday. I didn’t check the packaging there when I came home I noticed the product doesn’t come out like it doesn’t pump. Really disappointed and I live pretty far from sephora location its not worthto go back and exchange Mon fonds de teint préféré. J'ai une peau sèche et sensible et ce fond de teint rend ma peau unifiée et hydratée. I bought the dior foundation recently because I was trying to find similar one to Armani beauty. This one does feel like skin, i tried it and no creasing! I have combination to dry skin and it didn’t feel too greasy. It just felt like I had a nice glow. It didn’t oxidize either which is a plus. Overall I love this foundation and I’m so glad I bought it! Hopefully it wont dry me out for winter:) My favorite fondation: leaves your skin flawless and glowy. The only reason i am not giving 5 stars is because of the smell…the perfum smell is too strong 🥲 This is one of the best liquid foundation I’ve used. Never oxidized and color stay true for the whole day. It’s hydrating and glow just enough without looking shiny or oily. For those with cool undertones, I feel that the CR version is still slightly warm, so make sure you test the samples before purchasing it. The shade match is almost impossible to get right. Oxidized and left dry patches on my skin. I have de hydrated skin I need all the glow I can get. I’m so happy that the lady at Sephora recommended this foundation and I’m in love with it. It’s glowy light to medium coverage. Will re purchase in my winter shade All the CR and Neutral shades from this collection pulled yellow / orangey on my complexion. Until I discovered the shade 3C, it’s perfect for olive complexions. 3C & 3CR are not the same. A solid like. I don’t get the ‘glow’ or the ‘hydrating’ indicated but it’s definitely not matte. My coverage preference is light to light-medium coverage though I purchased knowing this was a medium to full coverage so I have that option but could sheer it out using a sponge. Overall it’s just a like for me. I prefer the Backstage. This has really good coverage and it lasts me the whole day I‘ve used many foundations throughout my years but this foundation, by far, exceeds all others for a woman who has not had any injections & does not use filters. This is very hydra for harsh winters. I can’t wait to purchase the matte formula for summertime. I love this foundation so much. First of all, 00N is a perfect shade match for my ultra fair, neutral-cool skin and it does not oxidize on me. It's fuller coverage but still looks like skin and has a beautiful, radiant finish. I stopped using foundation while we were all masking up during the pandemic, but have since started using it again as of Winter 2023. My skin looks beautiful, even on a bad skin day, and I just purchased my second bottle. The product goes on really nicely and has a lovely finish. The problem for me is that 0CR still has a yellow undertone even though it's supposed to have a cool undertone. As a result it's too yellow and dark for my pinkish pale skin. There's also a very heavy perfume smell to the product. You don’t need anything except moisturizer to prep your skin before foundation, this foundation has everything in it, skin feels hydrated, gives you extraordinary glow without leaving it oily. This foundation is among the best I have used, easy to apply, offers medium coverage and settles in nicely. At last, a foundation that doesn’t oxidize orange on my sickly Victorian white skin!!! Great looking coverage, takes to my skin perfectly. I love the scent, the glow, the coverage. My foundation search is over, this is the one! This is the only foundation that does not flake on my dry eczema prone skin!!! It also has skincare benifits which give suit that glowy skin. Not heavy as well! First of all it has fragrance that i don’t like on my face. Secondly it does oxidise and look 2-3 shade darker . It look too orange after some time . Its a big no for me . It blends very easily. I just love it. It stays for long and it doesn't separate or look cakey. It's very important to prepare your skin before you apply it. If you use it after “Star filter” from Dior it's gonna be and look amazing. This is by far the best foundation I have ever purchased - it looks like skin and you can build it up or wear it very light. Just make sure you know it’s a water based foundation Ive tried over 10 glowy foundations and this is my go to. Lightweight, glowy but not oily, lasts all day. I had a super busy day, wore it from 830am to midnight. My skin still looked flawless. No primer just CT setting spray. This is one of those base products that just melds with your natural face oils and works so well with your other makeup products that it looks better as the day wears on. A must have for mature skin, I am 42 and this just makes you look so smooth and does not highlight imperfections It matches my skin tone !!!! I look like I have no make up at all I've tried so many different foundations before, and this has been the best one I've tried! It feels light weight on my skin and gives me a natural, airbrushed look. I would definitely recommend this foundation to anyone! Tried multiple shades of this foundation but no luck. 0CR was far too light, then tried 1CR and it was orange on me. I love the formula but unfortunately can't find a shade to match. Also has a very strong fragrance. The formula is so light and has good coverage. The shade for my skin tone is perfect! Love it. SUPER STRONG FRAGRANCE. Like rubbing perfume on your face. Other than that, the foundation oxidized a little weird on my skin and it broke apart in the T zone. After a few hours it settled into fine lines. Overall, not worth the price. Although I asked for a shade match, this shade looked green on me, I also had to use a lot of product to get the coverage that I wanted. The fragrance was very overwhelming and it started to settle into my fine lines. I have been using Dior Forever Skin Glow for over a year now. I have normal-dry, sensitive skin and have struggled for years to find a foundation I really like. So far this has been the best! Feels great on my skin and wears really nice throughout the day. I would definitely recommend it. This foundation is gorgeous on the skin and the colour match is just perfect but it broke me out in a matter of hours. Sure, I have sensitive skin and occasionally  get acne, but this was something else. My skin was inflamed and it was just awful. Honestly, I'm sure I could find much better elsewhere at a reasonable price. Pricey but worth it. Such a light-layer foundation that you forget you're wearing it. Having heard so many lovely things about this foundation, I was very eager to try it.  I was however Highly disappointed in the lack of inclusivity in the shade range .. there were some shades in warm olive but only till 3WO…. It would have been nice to extend that further into the darker colours. My favourite foundation. Perfect smooth/ glowy finish. Medium coverage, blurs redness & discolouration. Great for acne prone skin￼. Definitely thought I would like but didn’t do much for me. I was desperately seeking a buildable, hydrating, long-lasting, low maintenance foundation that works well with my skin. I’ve been searching for my perfect foundation for years.. 

I have very dry skin, with lots of natural smile creases around my eyes. Even the best setting powders crease on me.

With this foundation, I only have to use the tiniest amount to reach my desired coverage! It doesn’t cling to any of my dry patches, or settle in to creases or scars. The glow is amazing (no shimmer at all) just healthy glow that lasts all day. Photo taken in office lighting. Makes your skin glow! it smells amazing and has spf in it. Perfect amount of coverage for a more natural look. Absolutely loved this foundation! It keeps the skin looking  hydrated with its skincare factor while giving a glowy finish. I wanted to love this. I gave it a try and now that I am wearing it today after a few days or no makeup, I can see that it’s the wrong shade and the foundation settles into my pores and wrinkles. My favourite foundation! Has a beautiful dewy glow. Coverage is great. Buildable. Stays on all day. I will keep buying this one. Highly recommend This made my skin sooooooooo oily. Like, it wasn’t a dewy finish, it was like I had olive oil on my face. My face felt slimy. If I even lightly brushed my face, a whole layer of my makeup would wipe off (even though I used setting powder and spray). It slipped off my skin on my nose, around my mouth and on my forehead, and it clumped around my nose. This really did not work on my skin. Medium coverage foundation that sits beautifully on my skin. It’s lightweight and gives my dry skin a dewy finish.  It’s my go-to foundation as it’s a perfect match for me and I can easily apply it with my fingertips! The foundation itself is okay - although I think due to my more sensitive skin it felt a little drying.  It has a strong fragrance added which wasn't what I was looking for in my foundation. Overall it covers well and likely is a good product if you don't have sensitive skin like me:) It looked great on my face but it has fragrance. My eyes started burning shortly after I put it on yesterday. Today the skin around my eyes is red, swollen and it still stings. This foundation looks beautiful and is pretty long lasting. I give it a very light set with the Makeup Forever Twist powder on the Centre of the face and Charlotte tilbury airbrush setting powder 
everywhere else. It give you the juiciest glow and 
blurs out skin texture like a filter; my skin looked so beautiful. Only issue is it oxidized like crazy, and for a neutral shade it went quite peachy ): I would suggest to buy a shade lighter than your skin tone. It also clinged to dry spots where I have eczema but overall beautiful finish I’ve used other foundations over the past few years and have ended up with break outs or irritated skin. I should have never strayed from this Dior formula, it’s truly my must have foundation! Beautiful finish for the first hr then skin starts to feel tight and dehydrated in the middle of a hot summer. Also gave me bumps due to the dryness i guess. Wouldn't recommend. This is one of my favourite foundations. Makes skin look so smooth and it’s so beautiful!! Beautiful finish but feels tight and drying on my combination skin type face in the middle of summer.  Sensitive skin people also should be aware cause of the hight alcohol content and strong fragrance, after 2 full day of use my face got few red irritation bumps. It felt very lightweight on skin with a natural glow.
I was able to get my exact shade, it lasted all day but the only downside was that it oxidized after a few hours SO NICE ON THE SKIN!! I would purchase this immediately if it wasn’t that expensive ! It looks and feels amazing. The skincare in the formula is a huge plus. I didn’t love this product. Maybe it was the colour but I felt it just sat on top of my skin and looked cakey. Didn’t matter what I used to apply. This is a winner in my books. I decided to try the glow version instead of the matte and boy was I surprised.  Having combo/oily skin, I normally don’t go for the glow.  

This is so fresh and natural looking without being shiny. Smoothed over my pores and covered my broken capillaries with little product. I set it with a bit of loose powder and it looked flawless.  So far I’ve worn this in the heat and it’s held up amazingly, lasting about 9 hours.  No oxidation, limited settling in my smile lines (let’s be honest…what foundation doesn’t) and no greasy mess at the end of the day.  Overall, a great foundation! This foundation is the best thing i have ever tried in my life. I can’t even find the words to explain how this foundation felt soo lightweight on my skin, but at the same time demonstrated an insane amount of coverage!! you must get this foundation it will work for any kind of event, as it can give you the coverage you want for an event, but can also be lightweight and hydrating for every day useinsane a Received a sample of this, the foundation goes on nicely, but it wouldnt stay until I set with loose pouder.  It also makes my pores more obvious.  Not for me. This foundation is the best. I was always hesitant to wear foundation because I have oily skin and no foundation has ever worked.  Dior did it right. This applies so well and makes my skin look so bright and glowy. Hydrates perfectly. This is the only foundation I will wear. The absolute BEST foundation I have ever used (and I have tried everything from Chanel to Armani, Haus Labs, Nars, Chantecaille etc). Perfectly matched. Fab consistency, goes on so well. Hydrating. Like second skin. Would buy 100 times over. I get this product instore sephora. I tried their free sample come with my orders . I went to store. I tried on my face. It really blends properly with fingers, had a beautiful glow, hydrating base. I am really happy. This is just like I’m using a foundation with moisturizer 
It’s dewy and nice 
Medium coverage I enjoy this product The perfect foundation 😍 i will never reconsider changing my foundation. Gives you a natural, clean look. Stays all day. Absolutely recommending! I love the colour . Blends perfectly with my skin tone . I love the final look , it covers enough and leave a glowy natural finish . I can notice the difference . Sometime I put my foundation and 
away from the bathroom and the. I am like wow I have a beautiful skin I went looking for a foundation I could wear for my wedding day and this is it! I love the way it smells, and it gives a nice glow to my combination skin without getting too oily. I absolutely love this foundation. It is my go-to and I use it every time I’m doing my makeup. The finish and glow this gives you is magnificent. I bought this in the shade 1N and it makes my skin look amazing. Definitely recommend this if you are looking for the perfect glow!! I am a Dior girl. From skin care to makeup. I was using backstage face and body but lately I felt dry. Then this beautiful product came out. I hoped that it would live up to my expectations and it definitely did. It is absolutely beautiful that you can just wear a thin layer and it will look just like perfect natural skin Honestly amazing! Covers just perfect, lasts all day, lightweight and breathable. Definitely my go too and will not be using anything else! This is good for people with dry to combination skin  and gives very smooth texture.
Lightweight and not at all cakey.
Good for daily wear. Light and looks like skin. I love the finish and glowy look once applied. However if you don’t like fragrance, I’d avoid this because it does have a strong floral scent Is not full coverage but my skin looks pretty healthy and glowing which I really liked, I was using Clinique but my skin was looking dry Very disappointed that I had to return this product given it's great reviews. Went on really nicely, perfectly matched my skin colour, and didn't have any strong fragrance smell. However, after a mere 3 hours it started to flake off and turned my face and neck yellow, even after experimenting with numerous different products used before applying (primers, moisturizers, etc). despite being labelled as glowy, it dries down matte on my skin, and clings to dry patches. looks very pretty in the first hour, but careful if you have dry skin!! Flawless full coverage Many foundations leave a cakey presence and dry out my skin. This one blends beautifully and you only need a very small amount ! I wanted to try this a few times before giving my final thoughts. Im a healthcare worker who regularly works 12 hour shifts. That being said, I have tried & tested SO many foundations this year. My issue with other foundations is the fact that it doesnt last through a shift. I was always dealing with creasing, patching, flaking and just looking cakey. I tried different skin prep, primers, setting powders/ sprays and nothing changed. Ive been wanting to try this foundation now for a while and finally did.. and let me tell you- this is the best purchase ive ever made. It holds up beautifully, and it still looks just as amazing at the end of the day. Every issue ive had with other foundations, never happened with this. 
I have very sensitive & acne prone skin and this has not given me any sort of reaction or break out. My first shift wearing it, i received so many compliments. It gave me my confidence back! I will continue to repurchase this. I dont have sensitive skin. I never broke out from a cosmetic product and this immediately caused the worst reaction on my face. My skin was dry itch and peeling. This foundation has a fragrance in it and it is not good for the skin. Sucks because i really liked the product. I bought this for my mom. She loved it so much that I had to buy one for myself. The coverage is outstanding. We have been using it for a bit now, this is her 4th bottle and my 1st. Will definitely buy again! This foundation leaves a beautiful dewy finish in my over 50 skin!! Dior doesn't disappoint.  Even better layered. Do the coverage that works for you.  Lasts all day perfectly. Too expensive. I wear it everyday. Received my order today from Ulta, and it's already expired. Will buy directly from Dior from now on. Do better, Ulta. I have rosacea and little bumps on my cheeks due to my rosacea. I pump 3 full pumps on the back of my hand, apply it to my face with a foundation brush, and I'm done. The finish is absolutely gorgeous, especially when pairing it with Huda Beauty's Cherry loose setting powder under my eyes, my nose, above my lip, and my chin. It's necessary for me to find a good foundation and a good powder because I live in Phoenix, AZ. As soon as I step outside, the heat beats down on me. The SPF in this foundation is obviously not enough, so first I moisturize with Pond's, put a 60+ SPF sunscreen cream on, Power Grip primer, then my foundation. My foundation has never looked so good! I don't care what anyone else says, but I love the scent of the foundation. I feel so pretty and luxe when applying it and smelling it. I'm on my second bottle and I will definitely be purchasing it again as it is my new regular foundation. I only hope that maybe Dior considers adding more SPF to it, but not if it changes the current formula. My favorite foundation I mix it with elf halo glow. It's the best foundation I've used This has so far been the best foundation I have found for my mature skin. I am so far happy with it. I am a week in and still happy!! The finish was very greasy and blotchy. I tried with several different applicators and primers. I have textured, dry skin. Would probably look great as light coverage on clear skin! This is my go to foundation. Absolutely love the color match and the sustainability of the product. I love this foundation but the smell is outrageous! I cannot take it. I smelled it for a couple of hours. I never write reviews . It feels great, and initially goes on great. I always use the Porefessional primer w/ any foundation.. then a sheer setting powder. Well my normal 2 foundations look great all day, pores look normal. The Dior lasted a couple hours before creeping all in my pores- making them stand out too much. Don't recommend if u have somewhat large pores.. mine r like medium craters w/ no makeup- lol I have been using this for over 2 years now and love the dewy look and that it's buildable. Blush, powder, and concealer goes over it perfectly. It does oxidize and has an odd smell though. To me it doesn't smell like fragrance, but more like a chemical smell such as alcohol. For the price point, I think I will be researching alternatives. Inloce a foubdation that guves a natural finish (not too matte, not shiny) and a bit of a ""radiant"" look with lightvreflecting sheen (but not some ghastly psychedelic prism effect). 

Based in thecdescriotion, inhooed this fitvthe above. It dies not. It keaves a shiny finish that is a bit ""sticky"" to the touch. I dud not care for it. I have nornal skin, perhaps occasionally (winter) on the dry side. I have tried working with this product in sooo many ways and no matter what it becomes textural, dry, and patchy. Its just plain ugly. Ive never experienced anything like it. I also never leave reviews but after many months of trial and disappointment, I felt compelled to tell you to save your money. Love Dior generally good grief A makeup artist applied this shade and it looked identical to my Cool tone pale skin. I was given a sample and used it at home. The color faded and turned out whiter than my skin tone. Half of my face was white and the other side was my natural pale skin with rosacea. Applied to entire face and I see streaks on my cheeks and it doesn't set well with Setting spray. I wanted to love this but its not giving me a natural dewy finish or the same color match. Too white! This is actually the worst foundation I've ever used. I don't understand any positive reviews?? Cakey, oxidized, and hard to wash off. My skin looked more even and glowy before I put this junk on. Dior should stick to making handbags. Best foundation ever. The foundation goes on smoothly it gives a natural finish but gets so freaking blotchy and basically disappears when wearing after an hour or two not worth the price I love the foundation looks flawy but after 5 hours i get patchy spots in my face. My face is not oily is more dry i use a hydrating moisturizer but not working for me Extremely hydrating and moisturizing. Exactly what I was looking for!! ❤️ I'm Asian fair/light neutral skin and olive overtone, and for reference my PERFECT shade is Estée Lauder's 1W2 Sand; even though the Dior glow foundation doesn't have my color (1.5N was too pink and 1.5W was juuuuust a bit too yellow), I fell in love with the formula the first time i tried it - it was instant natural but impressive coverage, with just pea size product on my brush! And this formula is extremely glowy, so a litte definitely goes a Loooong way. 
I have also been mixing this foundation with lighter BB cream to create my own shade, its been great - the glow stayed on ALL DAY. In comparison, Estée Lauder is just a bit smoother and matte. 
Hope this helps! I like this foundation, I would love it if my skin werent so problematic. If you have no acne or discoloration im sure this will be great for you! It has a nice glowy look without looking oily. It did not separate or settle into pores! Definitely worth a try I really like this foundation. I feel like it has such a pretty glowy finish. I like the dewy finish even though I have oily skin so I do start to look oily much faster but still very pretty. I would love this product much more if it didnt transfer! The transfer is so bad and I switched to a different foundation because if it. I really like this foundation. I feel like it has such a pretty glowy finish. I like the dewy finish even though I have oily skin so I do start to look oily much faster but still very pretty. I would love this product much more if it didnt transfer! The transfer is so bad and I switched to a different foundation because if it. Ive tried 20+ foundations and have drawers full of pumps and liquids.  I was jaded when I tried it on, but was plesantly surprised !  The finish is demi-satin on my combination skin, good coverage without being mask-like. I couldn't find a foundation that would not settle into my pores and look flaky. Until I found this. It looks natural and the color selection is huge!  So happy I found this brand.  It's a little more expensive but so worth it! I have been using this foundation for 3 years. It has good coverage without being thick.
Good selection of colors to match anyone. I loved how this felt on my dry skin and it didn't seem to clog my acne-prone skin, but I am a very pale person with very neutral undertones. All of the shades either make me look yellow and somehow too dark or make me look even paler, even if its a darker shade due to the undertones. It also didn't last as long as I wish it did for the price point, but it's Dior so I can't complain. As long as you aren't the color of like a cracker this would probably work just not for the super pale, not yellow or pink girlies. I am not one to stray from my usual makeup routine. However, turning 50 has made me change it up. My Ulta consultant talked me into trying this foundation. I am so glad she did. Does not look cakey and does not seem to settle into my fine lines like my last one did. This will be my go to from now on. I am not a pro with makeup, but after trying a few other products this was my favorite and used for my wedding. It did not disappoint either! Had me feeling like I was glowing, smooth application and gives the picture perfect glow look. Not too much, but just enough! Blended very well and gave me the extra boost of confidence on my big day! You do not need a whole lot either so it lasted me over a month almost 2 and I was wearing about everyday. I have used/ tried every foundation. This is by far the best. It doesn't sit in fine lines, keeps me glowing. All is really need is half a pump. I use the concealer too in a shade lighter Great foundation! As someone who lives in a dry area so my skin is constantly dry, this foundation worked so well with me! I absolutely loved it! Only downside is that I think I got the wrong shade because I look orange lol but i still love it! btw this foundation has a slight floral scent! Makes it seem like I have good skin. it's not super glowy which I like. I lightly powder. Looks really nice. I'm wearing this in winter and it's going well. Im hoping it holds up in summer because its beautiful.My skin is combination. I have been wearing estee lauder foundation for years after switching from urban decay after urban decay changed their foundation line. Estee lauder gives the perfect coverage, but is very thick. I also had a hard time matching the perfect color. Dior is my new favorite! Smooth, better matching of colors, and the perfect coverage. Also a plus that it smells amazing! Super fast shipping!

I also had a hard time matching the perfect color. Dior is my new favorite! Smooth, better matching of colors, and the perfect coverage. Also a plus that it smells amazing! Super fast shipping! I am 38 with dry skin. I told the consultant that Im a having trouble finding makeup that didn't settle into lines and didnt come out cakey and flakey. She recommended hygen primer and Dior make up. She color matched me with the very first bottle she picked up! It matches perfectly! And I'm happy with the results. I can wear make up agian! This is so cakey and made me break out worse than I've ever broken out before and I dont have acne. I love this foundation so much! I have very dry skin, and this does not cling to any dry patches. It makes my skin look hydrated and it is super lightweight. However, there is a slight floral fragrance to it, that I was not used to at first. The best color match for me I've ever found in my 50 years. It's medium coverage and not buildable, so for the little spots that I need a bit more, I dab on the Dior foundation stick. Such a natural look. Foundation is the only Dior product I own, but I recommend trying it. I can use much less product than other brands, imo it's the same price at the end and looks better. As mom said, you get what you pay for. Got the shade 00n and it matches perfectly. Its a actual super pale foundation without looking like face paint! First off I love this because of the shade match... I am a light medium olive, which is hard to find. This also gives a beautiful glow, I have dry skin .so I like it,  it doesn't settle into fine lines ... only problem is the transfer... it's awful if you have babies or toddlers.. of if your partner loves to cuddle.. it will transfer The lady who was helping me was dead on. I had been previously sold a concealer/Foundation, which made me look orange, Monique picked the Perfect color For me,  I could not be happier! The Ulta I went to is located in the promenade Plaza located in Edgewater, New Jersey This foundation is light, covers my flaws, and lasts 24 hrs. It does smudge off or get cakey. Dior products are the best@ I don't understand what justifies the high price of this foundation. The color match was beautiful, but the TRANSFER! I have tried every primer, powder  and setting spray but this transfers on everything. And the smell is odd. I wanted to love this foundation because I heard so many great things about it but I had to wash it off after 10 minutes because I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance in it. Product is definitely very hydrating but it oxidizes after a while. Matches my skin tone perfect feels and looks great my favorite foundation Ive used pretty much every foundation out there and I have to say this one is # 1 !!!!! Best coverage, color match and longevity. Love everything about it. its not a full coverage foundation I have tried many foundations and this will always be my go to. I have acne scars and this covers them and leaves such a glow natural finish. I'm obsessed. Perfect shade and perfect texture. Fast delivery and great product. Love this foundation. Long lasting, and goes on smooth. Does not look heavy. I love this product!  It makes my skin look flawless I love the skin finish , mi face never look amazing I don't usually like foundation because I find it to be too heavy or fall into creases. I bought the foundation brush and I love this product! Beautiful gives you that beautiful glow!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The formula is amazing my skin has never looked this good with any other product def worth buying! I love this foundation. Goes on like a dream, last all day. Its patchy, it slides off my skin no matter what setting product i put over it. If you have any kind of lines on your forehead, around your nose, mouth its goong to soak in those lines. Just the worst foundation i have ever bought which is extremely disappointing given the price and brand. This foundation is top tier. Originally I was a little concerned about the fragrance but its been a few months and I havent broken out (I have ezcema too). It gives the most natural glow but doesnt make you look oily. No one can ever tell I'm wearing foundation when I wear this. The foundation looks best if you exfoliate your skin and use toner + moisturizer. I usually apply with my hands or spatula. I usually blend it out with fingers and/or a beauty blender. Great breakfast I've ever had and loved it.  Most definitely would recommend this place I love this product as it stayed in my skin naturally. I LOVE this foundation. It adds a very nice glow to skin and feels very light weight. Love the way it feels on my skin and how it doesn't feel like make up.  Highly recommend. Great coverage, love how moisture my skin and it last the whole day!!! I love the coverage of this foundation. It's able to fully conceal any blemishes but retain a skin-like finish. The application is phenomenal, it goes on like silk. I love love this product as a 1st time purchase!! Beautifully blended and I just stumbled upon by chance because I previously bought another brand, but this is my new go to! this is the most amazing foundation! it provides full coverage but it does not look cakey. it hydrates and smooths my skin! the foundation does not set orange. it has a deep tan, pink undertone. truly the best! This is the best foundation I have ever used. It goes on smoothly, is natural looking, lasts all day and more. It even moisturizes so that my skin looks fresh, with a healthy glow. I did not love this foundation like I thought I would. Did not sit well on skin. Had to take off right after because it did not agree with my skin. Does have a good shade range. For the price I would not purchase. Love this foundation and it goes on so smoothly with the Dior brush! My favorite foundation! Goes on beautifully with the Dior brush and gives an even coverage all around. subtle glow and a smooth finish. Compliments the skin texture and tone beautifully. Loved the product. The shade is exact match to what I sod looking This is my first time trying foundation from Dior. It gives nice coverage and smells great. The lightweight formula feels really comfortable and you can build it up without it getting heavy or cakey. gifted by Dior. My skin feels hydrated all day long! The color blended perfectly. this foundation is so gorgeous it's lightweight with a beautiful soft finish and leaves a subtle glow. It feels nice on the skin like your not even wearing makeup it's definitely my new favorite! Highly recommend and this was gifted by christiandiorbeauty This foundation is really nice and glowy. Its not for matte makeup lovers. I love that it also has some spf so you dont have to use two different products Me encanta el acabado, deja la piel luminosa. Recomendada my most favorite foundation. very well applied to the skin. lasts all day. I get many compliments on how flawless my skin looks Very heavy did not like plus it has a rare smell This foundation dries my skin like crazy. I tried twice, on the 1st day with my regular skincare, and felt very dry after a few hours. On the 2nd day, I added layers of moisturizer and had the same results, so I am disappointed and definitely returning it. It's the best makeup I have ever used! I am in my 50's now. This is worth the money to me! I love this one, I bought it to try something new after my Armani ran out and I wasn't disappointed. It's very creamy and pigmented and provides great coverage. It blends so nicely and doesn't feel heavy on the skin but lasts through the whole day Loved this foundation and surprisingly I matched myself perfectly online. The foundation was not too heavy and I loved the coverage. Thinking of purchasing a full size as I am running low on my current foundation. 
Gifted by ChristianDiorBeauty Really love this foundation. Left my skin looking smooth, hydrated and glowing even on my dryer skin! Always amazed either way Dior beauty products and how they are luminous and radiant. Will definitely reach for this product from now on! I as gifted by christiandiorbeauty. I am in ❤️.

It is super long lasting but didn't break up or look cakey on the skin. Gifted by christiandiorbeauty It's supposed to help with dry skin but it does the opposite, to me it drys my skin more and the texture doesn't feel good, would not recommend for dry skin but other than that it's good.

Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer,"I love how portable this mini is, it’s great for travel and a little goes a long way when I mix it with the B-hydra serum in the PM. It’s helped soothe my skin and feels so lightweight and not heavy at all. This may be better for a younger person and used in the summer.  It just felt like my skin was dry going on but then felt greasy all day.  I know it is contradicting, but that's exactly how it was for me.  So I probably won't try it again - even in the summer. Do NOT buy the refill! The moisturizer is great, but the refills no longer fit into the standard size product. I used to have no problem, but something has changed. I have purchased 2 new standard size containers and the refills do NOT work. Great overall product but I’ve spent too much extra $$$ trying to make the refills work. I used this product consistently until empty and could not see or feel a difference in my skin. I've had oily skin my entire life and haven't needed much in the name of moisturizer. I'm used to getting away with a light liquid (Dr Jart's is my holy grail).. but as I'm approaching 40, winters do dry me out, I'm noticing a change, and wrinkles starting to creep in. I've sampled the whole gamut of moisturizers thanks to Sephora, trying to find one that doesn't break me out.. hyaluronic acid causes me acne and it's in everything these days. I recently tried this one and it's serum cousin as samples - the serum breaks me out, but not this. This one is it. So I took the plunge and have been using it regularly for a week now, and no breakouts, even with gym workouts/sweat in the mix. It's definitely improved my skin quality and I like the dispensing mechanism, as I find jars unhygienic. Also happy they have the refill option to reduce plastic waste as well. The pump took a few uses to work well but in general very good product This product has let me down. 

The moisturizer itself is doing a good job on my skin, but the pump on the unit has failed. I’ve been using it for less than a week and the pump has stopped working. I’ve tried to shake it and bump it around in order to ensure that the product can reach the pump from inside, but it’s not working.

I’ve had to open the container to access the moisturizer which means it’s no longer kept sterile. This is very disappointing given the purchase price. DO NOT BUY REFILL! Love the moisturizer but hate the refill. Caused me to lose so much product when twisting the pump back in place. i received a travel sized moisturizer in a Sephora kit and really enjoyed it. the moisturizer isn't too thick and a small amount goes a long way. i feel like too much of the product especially around the lips and nose feels as if you're sweating so you really only need a pea sized amount for the whole face. it wasn't oily and dries down nice, however my only complaint is the smell. it smells almost like a stale hospital to me. other than the smell i really do enjoy this moisturizer and would purchase a full sized version. Was using it for a few years and then the new formulation gave me a red rash all over my face and was stinging. I think this was recalled a few times. It smells horrible like it’s spoiled. I decided to try some on one half of my face anyway and within a few minutes my whole face started to swell on that side and now it feels hot and is red. I’ve never had that reaction to anything before. I have been using this product for a week and I am already in love with it, it is very moisturizing and works well with acne! I love mixing the bronzi drops with it also! And I love how you pump it so I don’t have to stick my fingers in it and get the moisturizer dirty! I would definitely recommend!my my The product is great, the refill is awful!! DO NOT BUY THE REFILL!  It’s not worth the few dollars you save!  I was able to use the refill a couple times with no problem, now I can never get the refill to go into the push pump. So I wind up covering it with tinfoil and using it out of the container.  I’ve tried it with multiple push pumps, and no luck. I really like this moisturizer, it’s hydrating and leaves my skin soft but it is really thick and I personally prefer thinner moisturizers I absolutely adore this moisturizer. I first discovered it in 2019 and instantly fell in love. I used it consistently for two years before getting curious and testing out other popular brands like Biossance, Tatcha, Youth to the People, Dieux, Dr. Dennis Gross, and Skinfix. After all that experimenting, I’ve come full circle—this is my holy grail. It deeply nourishes and repairs my skin barrier, keeps my combination skin hydrated, and never causes irritation (and I have very sensitive skin). A definite must-have! I love this moisturizer but the refills do not work.  I have purchased the refill twice now and both times it pops right in and then the pump doesn't work (no product comes out).  Then when I try to take it out the bottom part of the pump gets stuck in the refill and I can't get it loose. I have been using this product for the past few weeks and has lasted me about 1 months now and I love it and use it everyday but it's very thick. I absolutely love this product! Is fragrance free and alcohol free and perfect for my very sensitive skin, it doesn’t leave a greasy feeling. It’s great for the summer. This is an amazing product, it is just VERY thick. You have to put a few fingers fulls of product to get it to blend in without also rubbing around nothing on your skin. For $26CA it is pretty small. I like this product but for the price I would probably not buy it again. Drunk elephant products have always been a favorite! This one is very moisturizing and luxurious feeling, clean and “unscented” but sometimes has an unpleasant scent like dirty towels. But better than fake fragrances!!! My favorite thing about DE is their packaging, product stays clean and sanitary without having to open caps to environment or stick your fingers inside. Easy to stack in vanity. I love drunk elephant. I use this when I need extra hydration! I am in love with this moisturizer! It is well worth the money if you have issues like eczema or dry skin. It moisturizes without leaving my skin oily. A must have for dry or combination skin. Was okay, my skin never felt fully moisturized after using. I have skin barrier issues and was in the market for something that would help with barrier repair. This is not that product. My skin was still flaky and because of the barrier issue, it actually stung to put this on. And I used this for a month (not ideal with the stinging but I was desperate). I just thought that with it supposed to “reinforce skin barrier” and “soothe + replenish skin” that it would help but it did not. I definitely would not buy again but it might be good for someone else’s skin type. I would love to give this product five stars I really would. but it's a little too expensive a little too out of my price range. I still bought it to try it out and it's really good and moisturizing. but it kind of broke the bank a little. still recommend but still expensive! Very nice texture and packaging, but it smells like Play-Doh i have dry skin, and while this product is very moisturizing, it doesn't absorb well—even after exfoliating beforehand. It’s a great product, but it is very expensive and it also is only filled up one or 2 inches before you get the refill but it is such a great product otherwise ￼ The ingredients in this product are good, but I feel like the moisturizer just sat on top of my skin instead of melting into my face. Didn’t experience a deep hydration. The smell is not that bad! wanted to try this for so long but was pretty disappointed w the product. not sure if i just grabbed a bad one (just my luck), but it doesn’t feel very moisturizing and the smell sort of reminded me of play dough. my skin’s more on the drier side so it felt like i was using a DRY moisturizer where it just had a hint of moisturization. everyone’s different but this just didnt work out for me:) Made my skin feel greasy and caused a breakout on my chin. I have combination skin and it’s been dry lately so I tried this and it just didn’t work. I did like the dispenser and that it’s refillable, but ultimately returned because it just didn’t work. Very thick, no scent. Perfect for those dry days. I use a lot of retinols and this is just perfect. I have acne prone and oily skin - I’ve had no problems. I didn't really have that much product in it also I broke me out a couple times and the smell of it is literally terrible. Super moisturizing but didn’t feel thick or heavy. Kept my skin barrier healthy while using actives. Perfect for Dry skin!!! Very expensive and the mini is the size of my lip balm!! I have very dry dehydrated skin, nothing seems to moisturize it well so I got this as a sample. Very greasy and it somehow doesn’t feel moisturizing enough. Super moisturizing! This moisturizer is really thick, which is good for dry skin, I only figured this out until after I bought it though. the best moisturizer ever. for some reason my refill didn't fit in my moisturizer container this last time I purchased it but my purchases before then did so not sure what has changed... but i just scooped the product out and put it in the container and it works just fine. this moisturizer feels like your rubbing in a fluffy cloud on your face. I LOVE LOVE LOVE I honestly tried to love this product, after 2 weeks of using it, my skin has been breaking out more than ever. Works wonders on my boyfriend’s skin though lol. It’s definitely not for everyone! Can’t get past the price though. Felt like dry pasted on my skin, not a lovely moisturizing experience. Returned immediately. Love this product even though it is expensive there is a lot of product in it This product is not for people who have dry and sensitive skin. I have Rosacea as well and this product literally irritated my face so much it started peeling as well. I only used it 4 times and used very little product it but I still reacted very badly. I wasn’t expecting such great results. It is very moisturizing sinks into the skin and gives it a healthy glow. It plumped my skin as well. What was really surprising is that it brightened and evened out my skin tone. I’m in my 40s and this is incredible!! This is a great, workaday moisturizer. I like to use it in my rotation of various creams, mostly for daytime, but sometimes as a light night cream if I'm using a heavier serum. The one thing that really seals the deal for me in restocking this often is that they offer refills to reduce plastic. I hope Drunk Elephant continues to offer this kind of packaging for all it's products. Any time I can save plastic from the landfills then I'm willing to spend a little more. I loveeee this cream! It is so smooth and creamy and makes my skin feel so soft and glowy. The packaging is really nice, I like the applicator because it just gives you the exact amount you need. Also love the ingredients in this one This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I was scared of the price but it has definitely been justified. The ceramides really help my skin to be smooth and hydrated and my texture is completely gone. Lala Retro Nourishing Whipped Moisturizer has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. Its creamy, whipped texture feels luxurious and absorbs easily into the skin without feeling greasy. I love how soft and hydrated my skin feels after using it, and it works wonderfully as both a day and night moisturizer. Perfect for dry skin, it leaves a smooth, plump finish that lasts all day. Really great product but super expensive , could buy an alternative Great staple heavy duty moisturizer! Lala has ceramides and oils that do a great job of nourishing the skin. This is a thicker moisturizer and is great for the winter time or if your skin is dry. If you have oily skin this may be one you want to use at night or during the winter My skin always dries out in the winter months and it can be very difficult to keep it moisturized. Drunk Elephants Lala Retro has been a lifesaver for my skin. I apply it once in the morning and my skin feels soft and hydrated all day! I got a free sample of this and loved it. When I saw two sizes I went for the lower cost, not realizing it was only a bit larger than a quarter. Unless you are looking for a travel size, just buy the more expensive bottle. 
Aside from the size- the moisturizer itself is great. Love this moisturizer! It’s rich but not greasy, super hydrating, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way, and it absorbs really well. Perfect for dry skin or when you need extra moisture. Definitely a staple in my routine! Really like how the moisturizer feels on my skin and how it keeps it hydrated. I will say though, there is a light scent to it, that kind of throws me off sometimes. I wish they had an unscented version instead. I am so impressed with the Lala Retro Whipped Cream Moisturizer from Drunk Elephant. I have very sensitive skin and this product was very soothing and moisturizing; my skin tolerated it extremely well. I love the airy texture of this moisturizer and how nourishing the ingredients are.

Would buy forever softer than cotton My skin feels great after using this product It is the first moisturizer that does not break my skin out. I have sensitive skin and Rosacea. I hardly notice the Rosacea since using this product. I hope they don't change or discontinue this cream.  I am on my 5th jar. A little goes a long way! This is so smart! Discount for a refill, which is more environmentally friendly. love the product! so glad that refills are available for these! love this cream! soaks in well, basically like ceramighty AF but for the whole face! This is one of the best face creams I have ever used

I did get the package where you can use the packaging a second time and could not get it to dispense at all. I love this moisturizer but after refilling it I can't get the pump to work. Please advise on how to refill, a video would be helpful Product doesn't feel
Moisturizing. Matte finish. I don't like that Jeeps my skin moisturized without braakouts I first received sample of the Lala Retro Whipped Cream as a sample as my birthday freebie. I could not believe what a difference it makes in how soft my skin feels and the tone. As soon as the sample ran out I bought a full size. Love it. The container was not completely filled and the price is too much but I love the produc I haven't even received this item yet! Im truly upset about this Caused my skin to breakout in small cluster Acne.
My skin was completely clear until I used this. Now I have acne all over the side of my face. Received this as a sample. I used it for about a week and starting breaking out. I love the way it made my skin feel but I dont recommend this product if you are prone to breaking out easy. Not for oily skin! It was a gift and I broke out, and unfortunately I break out in huge acne. I had 5 big pimples right away. I gave it to my mother in law. I'm still waiting for my pimples to clear up. It's been over a week or two. Unfortunately I cannot exchange the gift. I am going to return this product. It doesnt absorb well enough nor does it hydrate my dry skin. It actually causes me to have more flakes than normal. This is the second time I received a sample of face cream from this brand and yet again I didn't learn my lesson. breaking out in white heads and red and painful. I love this moisturizer. Very nourishing and helps with dryness. That's what I've been looking for. The fragrance is nice, and not overpowering, I can't believe someone would complain about the fragrance! Great product! I received it as a free sample. This moisturizer is light and perfect under makeup Thought it would be a little more fun and luxurious, just kind of smells and feels like a grandma cream. How i would expect like…an olay cream to feel I love the texture of this product.  It feels airy and smooth and absorbs well.  I don't like the way it smells.  I can't place what it smells like, but I had a Protini serum and that smelled the same way.  I know this brand doesn't add fragrances, but my nose is sensitive to something they use. Makes skin feel super smooth.  Love it Absolutely love it! Feels great on, my, skin, light, hydrating and my skin feels so soft! Hate the price tag but definitely recommend it. I received this as a sample w/ my purchase. It seems creamy & looks as though it would be hydrating. However, it only lasted maybe a few hours before I needed to reapply. I ended up applying 3x a day in order to keep my skin from feeling dried out. I have dry skin, so this seems like it may only work for normal skin. I live in Cali, & this heat is drying, so this creme doesn't not hold up. I would not recommend. Def not worth the price tag. I recommend Cosrx for Dry & sensitive skin. I got this as a sample as part of my order. I used it a few times and it's just okay. It feels nice on the skin - smooth, no fragrance. 

But I've been into skincare for over a decade now and in my opinion there are WAY better products out there for your money. The entire Drunk Elephant brand is so overpriced, over marketed, and unimpressive. I was really surprised at how much I love this moisturizer! I received a small sample as a gift with a previous order and tried it out right away. I've become obsessed and bought the full size the next day! The price scared me a little bit, but to me it's absolutely worth it. I love the texture, it's thick but not greasy. It goes on my skin matte, not shiny. It keeps my dry skin perfectly hydrated all day! I'm usually having to apply multiple times a day because my skin is so dry. I love the smell as well. I think it's technically unscented, but it smells like crayons to me, which I love. This product made me break our in a huge rash. Do not buy for children I am 18 and it gave me hives and a rash I don't even know what made me try this. It was a gift  with purchase and given all the hype around this brand, I was expecting more. Definitely wasn't expecting for it to break out my face. I also didn't like how it spread across my face. It feels cheap. A very small amount was used because I did not like the consistency and it still broke my skin out. I wouldn't try any other product from this brand. Opened the package an low and behold it was already used with reminents of past product! Literally disgusting. This is the only moisturizer that has been soothing for me, during these hot and humid days. Very moisturizing I love this moisturizer so much it does not break you out and is so hydrating.  I also love the packaging it's so cute and works so well. Not worth the hype at all its moisturizing but literally never does anything Leaves me hydrated and spreads nicely.  Does not leave white streaks ands helps me feel ready for my day I will never stop recommending this moisturizer. I was scared of the price but it has definitely been justified. The ceramides really help my skin to be smooth and hydrated and my texture has completely vanished. Complimentary from drink elephant I was super excited to try this Lala Retro Nourishing Whipped Moisturizer complimentary from drunkelephant and Ive been loving it! This product provides intense hydration without being heavy. The rich, whipped texture is incredibly soothing and it's gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Great heavy duty moisturizer!

This moisturizer is creamy and thick but not greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and helps my dry combo skin stay moisturized all day. The pump packaging is super convenient for dispensing the right amount of product. The texture is incredibly light and airy, despite its rich feel, making it a joy to apply. This moisturizer shines in its ability to plump and soften the skin. It leaves a healthy, dewy glow rather than a shiny finish, which I appreciate. I found it particularly effective in combating dryness and restoring my skin's barrier, especially during harsher winter months. However, the price point is a significant drawback. Lala Retro is a premium product, and the cost per ounce is quite high. This makes it a difficult purchase for many, especially considering that there are other effective moisturizers available at more accessible price points. Gifted by drunkelephant I will preface my review by saying I have quite dry skin due to the environment. The winter months are especially dry and I enjoy using heavy, thicker creams. Now this cream feels like it was made specifically for my dry skin, I love it! 

The packaging is designed so that you don't have to dip your fingers into a pot, it's more of a jar that you push down to get the product to dispense. I appreciate this especially in terms of cleanliness. 

The ingredients include a Triple-ceramide blend and 5 African oils. I find this really provides the nourishment my skin needs especially in the dryer months. I appreciate that there is no fragrance as my face tends to break out with added fragrance. 

The design of the jar is innovative and I appreciate it as it helps keep the cream sanitary. The packaging consists of a jar that you push down to get the product to dispense. 

The texture of this cream has a thick, whipped, creamy feel. It truly feel like creamy butter. A little bit goes along way and I imagine this will last me 3 months or so (maybe more as we are heading into summer.) It feels very restorative on my skin and absorbs easily leaving my skin feeling hydrated. While the cream is quite thick and buttery, it does not feel heavy on my skin. 

I'd highly recommend this if you have dry skin and are looking for a powerhouse hydrating cream. I give it four stars for the quality, design, and effectiveness. Gifted by drunkelephant Gifted by Drunk Elephant for my honest review. One thing I really appreciate about this moisturizer is the packaging — no need to scoop the cream with your fingers, you just press the top and it dispenses the perfect amount. It's such a clean and easy design. The cream itself feels light, absorbs nicely, and seems perfect for normal to dry skin. Overall, a good option if you like practical packaging and a soft, whipped texture.",4.233333333333333,210
Estée Lauder Double Wear,"I don’t like the fact that I have purchased at a higher price from Sephora when I can buy the same from amazon at a cheaper price…… Price matters a-lot and I’m disappointed ! GOAT. A little goes a long way. It looks just as good on me as it did those who recommended it. A TRUE matte foundation, but does not look ashy. I’ve been using this product for over 20 years. I love that it’s consistently remained the same although as I start to get older, I’m starting to think that I might need to change because it lends itself more to oily skin or combination then dry mature skin. Really nice foundation long wear does not smudge or crease all day long 10/10 foundation, I get one shade for summertime when I’m more tan and a different shade for the winter time I become quite pale and both match my complexion amazingly.  I use the Armani luminous silk hydrating primer & it’s the perfectttttt base for this makeup formula. This gives me a really full coverage compared to other brands that I favor. Definitely one of my favorites, if not my favorite. I have been on a foundation journey, desperately trying to find the right foundation for my skin. I believe I have finally found it in Estée Lauder Double Wear. I’ve tried so many different high-end foundations, only to be disappointed. EL is perfect! It goes on smoothly. It doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles and pores. What I really used to hate was how my foundation would get “disturbed” around my nose where my glasses sit. That doesn't happen with EL. My skin is perfect and smooth. I cannot say enough good about this product. You will not regret trying it! J’utilise ce produit, depuis une semaine, mais il m’a donné des boutons. À la base, j’ai la peau normal à sèche, alors je ne le recommande pas, pour ce type de peaux. Par contre, j’ai aimé le fait qui soit léger, mat , bonne couvrance. Il dure toute la journée. Estée Lauder Double Wear completely lives up to the hype. I love that the coverage is buildable, from natural to full. If applied correctly, it never feels heavy or cakey on the skin. I truly appreciate it's staying power. It genuinely lasts all day without melting, fading, or separating. It's a great choice for special occasions or long work hours, as it holds up even through heat & humidity. This is the only makeup product that breaks me out after using it This is the first time I’ve splurged on a foundation, and it was worth it. I have rosacea on my cheeks and have struggled to find a foundation with good coverage that doesn’t feel heavy. This covers my redness and it lasts all day (paired with a primer). I have brown skin and was struggling to find a foundation that matched my olive/neutral undertone skin (and did not oxidize and make me look dull). THIS is my favourite foundation now and I ONLY use this for both casual wear and events! A classic and I have very oily skin and so far this has been the best for it. After a couple hours of wear my oils do come through but not looking overly oily and can usually just lay away and then set with some more powder. I love  how it settle sons kin teven with texture Incredible product. I don’t use foundation normally but tried this because I want to do my own makeup at my wedding. No primer but set with Urban Decay all nighter (applied with a damp beauty blender). It didn’t move at all or make my face look cakey and weird, even after an outdoor brunch in Miami and a hot yoga class! My absolute holy grail. This is for oily/combo skin with pores and freckles if you sweat a lot this will not budge on you! i was amazed at how accurate the online color matching was. it was a perfect match I was charged for this item when I didn’t purchase it at the Kohl’s South Point location. I didn’t notice until I checked the app for past purchases. I wont be buying in person anymore since they cant ring up items properly. So good, gives your perfect full coverage makeup look. And it lasts so long. I bought this for my friend’s bridal makeup kit. It’s so pretty Foundation. I recommended😻😻😻😻😻  2W2 RATTAN & 3W2 CASHEW. I’m honestly so sad to be writing this review because Estée Lauder Double Wear has been my holy grail foundation for the last 10 years. It was my go-to for a flawless, long-lasting finish, and I always loved how it could keep my skin looking matte and perfect all day without budging. But recently, it seems like their formula changed. It’s patchy, cakey, and just doesn’t sit well on my skin anymore. No matter how I apply it, whether with a brush or sponge, it starts to look uneven and accentuates texture, something I never had issues with before. It’s almost like the formula doesn’t blend as smoothly or provide the same airbrushed effect it used to.

I’ve tried everything! Different primers, different skincare routines, but nothing brings back that flawless finish I once loved. It’s such a shame because for years this was the perfect foundation for me, and now I can’t even wear it without feeling like it’s making my skin look worse. I’m so sad to see it go from a 10/10 to something I can’t rely on anymore. I usually try a bunch of different products and feel like they’re OK, but I’ve been consistently buying this foundation for about three years now. I have dry skin with acne and it works great! Holy Grail! So, I was a Smashbox, Studio Skin 24 Hour Wear Hydrating Foundation girlie for YEARS and then the very unfortunate day came where they discontinued it. I was smart and stock pile bought several bottles to keep me going for at least a year and a half to hold me over until I could search for something that was just as good. I knew it would be a VERY daunting journey because lets face it, Smashbox Studio Skin was literal perfection. Fast forward to now. Just started on my last bottle of Smashbox Studio Skin and unfortunately know the time has come to start my search for what is an irreplaceable product. I've tried Milk, Yensa, and other foundations up to this point and honey, it's a no for me. I'm 38. Very minimal lines and no wrinkles (thank God) for now however, those lines and laugh lines that happen through out the day around the brow and eyes can look worse with makeup on than they do without makeup. My biggest hurdle with foundations was the creasing and the often times, icky damp feeling that I would get after 8 hours of wear. I went to Sephora to get samples of a few foundations I had been eyeing. They didn't have those foundations at that store however, they talked me into trying this Estee Lauder Double Wear. For the record I would have NEVER even thought to try this due to some of the reviews so, I was like sure, it's a free sample, why not try it. THIS IS IT. My flabbers are GASTED. I wore this on a Saturday just in case it made me look gross throughout the day and honey, it survived an all day session of painting our house, physically intense house work with near ZERO creasing and kept me matte and honestly looking like I just put on a fresh face of makeup even though I had been wearing it for over 10 hours. I AM FLOORED. I will say, it is a bit drier that I'm used too however, I will take it. Finally a foundation that does not make me look 50 years old after 8 hours of wear. It does not easily transfer and is incredibly lite on the skin. Great coverage without being cakey and easy to blend. Love it. Nice pale shades! Great for goth looks. Use a brush to apply I have tried SO MANY foundations in my lifetime, but I have never really found something that works well for me. I work in a greenhouse in the summer and our winters here are SO COLD. This foundation is just so amazing! It hold on through the most extreme weather conditions, hot or cold!  I will never use another brand! It’s worth every penny!! Stays all day. Best foundation I’ve used so far, doesn’t break me out. This is the first foundation that was my perfect match. It went on well and lived up to double wear promise My all time favorite foundation. As an oily girly, this is the only thing that keeps me matte all day. This covers everything! Will continue to use this❤️ The BEST long lasting foundation. I’ve been buying this for a year. You can do one layer and get a good coverage.. if you want absolutely full coverage that doesn’t look cakey, this is the one. It does feel heavy. 👌 This is the best foundation i’ve ever used! It matches my skin perfectly and lasts all day. It’s such a pretty foundation and everything lays so perfect on top of it! I love this foundation so much. It’s the best foundation for combination type of skin with acne. It lasts for really long, doesn’t clog pores and doesn’t cause any breakouts. Everyone loves and recommends this foundation. I wanted to love it, but my skin HATES it. It’s super cakey…I all for full coverage, but there still needs to be a skin like appearance. Not for me. I’m so in love with this foundation. I was a little bit nervous about the tone, but it’s perfect, looks very natural.
To get the right tone I checked out through findation.com it didn’t gave me the right one that it was almost my tone. It’s the perfect product. It’s always been one of my favorites. It’s expensive, but it’s really worth it. I’ve been using it for years and no regrets. I have used this foundation for years. I’ve tried switching to other brands but nothing compares. Leaves the skin looking flawless air airbrushed I have used a lot of foundations over the years and while I have a couple favorites, this is the one I recommend most and swear by. It is definitely worth the $$ if you can afford it, a little bit of it goes a long way so the bottle tends to last me a long time. Shade too dark. A bit too runny but lightweight! Seems like it would last long This is the foundation that makes the makeup look high end .. i do not have words to explain the coverage it gives. What happened?! I’ve been a loyal Double Wear user for over 10 years (and even worked for Estée Lauder (& Sephora) in the past), and it has always been my holy grail foundation. Unfortunately, my most recent bottle from Sephora caused a severe allergic reaction and eczema flare-up. I’ve dealt with swollen eyes, rashes on my eyelids, under my nose, and around my mouth, and it took me over a month to figure out the culprit was Double Wear.

I completely overhauled my skincare routine thinking something else was to blame, and relied on prescription steroid cream just to manage the symptoms—only for the flare-ups to return. Once I eliminated Double Wear, my skin started improving.

I haven’t seen any official word on a reformulation, but something seems different. I’m so sad, because nothing compares to Double Wear, and I wish this wasn’t the case. :( nan I wanted to buy this foundation because it’s been around for a long time and it’s still loved by many. I typically buy foundations where skin care is one of the primary focus. This smelled like alcohol! I have dry skin, so that was a red flag for me. I did prep my skin by using a heavy moisturizer and a dewy primer. To me, this was ok. I only applied one pump with a sponge because it can appear cakey if you are not careful. I do not plan to repurchase. Has a great coverage used it on a beach day and make up looked good at the end of the night since it is waterproof Love this foundation looks fabulous I always get compliments!!!!! I've been pretty loyal to Estée Lauder double wear for 10 years. I do own many foundations because I love trying new products but this one has remained on my top 10. The coverage is great, the longevity is also amazing. I do however which it had the same consistency that lancome has more breathable but with the same coverage. It does tend to feel heavy for me after a long day. I do recommend it. I do makeup professionally and this is my all time favorite foundation. It is full coverage without being cakey and will last all day. Estée Lauder 
Double Wear Stay-in-Place 24-Hour Longwear Foundation
Color: 7N1 Deep Amber - extra deep with neutral brown undertones Superrr...Perfect🖤love it.Estee Lauder👌3N2 Wheat medium This has become my holy grail foundation! This is great for oily skin. My dry skin girls may not love it as much. This is full coverage, easy to blend, and has a gorgeous natural skin like finish.  It dries down so much that I don’t need to set it with powder! One of my favorites!!!!  This foundation is a very versatile foundation you can wear it on its own for a full coverage look or you can mix with some oil drops or milky toner or essence to create a beautiful dewy look. I’m obsessed 😍 Worse foundation I’ve ever used. I applied this different ways to try and make it work and it failed every time. It creases into every line, shows every pore, and just looks awful every.single.time. The only people raving about this product were paid. I haven't tested yet but I believe Estee won't disappoint me I’m on the fence. I used the sample on my forehead and had excellent results, but when I purchased a bottle it seems to be breaking up on my skin. I’ve tried with a brush, a blender and my fingers but it’s no use. I’m going to try with a different primer and see if it makes a difference Estée Lauder 
Double Wear Stay-in-Place 24-Hour Longwear Foundation
Color: 7C2 Sienna - extra deep with cool, rich-red undertones Double Wear Stay-in-Place 24-Hour Longwear Foundation
Color: 1N0 Porcelain - very light with neutral undertones After trying other foundations, this is always the one I come back to. The shade range is incredible and the coverage is very buildable. I have normal-combination skin (in my t-zone) and this foundation blends beautifully without making my makeup look cakey. It really does last all night, and I know I can rely on it for a night out. If you’re thinking about buying it, do it! I love this foundation. I do have dry skin, but I love the matte finish. I really don’t like the glow look 10 out of 10 would recommend. ￼ The best foundation I've ever used. Perfect medium coverage, blends with my skin perfectly, lasts for hours with no touch-ups. Flawless. Absolutely in love with it!! Stays on the whole day It is an excellent foundation, a staple in my routine, can’t live without it I’ve tried so many foundations and will always re purchase this one - this is my all time fav foundation - it truly will stay on all day and I don’t use powder - it’s amazing - I do prep my skin skin care and it looks amazing Love the buildable coverage without caking. As someone in her mid 30s it is light and works great for my skin. The only downside is the application process is tricky since it doesn’t have a pump or sponge applicator. However you do not need much product. This foundation will never disappoint me. I recently came back to this one because I needed something more matte and medium to full coverage. I was hesitant because I do have sensitive cystic acne prone skin, but so far so good. Pairs great with the MILK pore eclipse matte primer. It is on the heavier side, so if you prefer to ""feel"" your skin, you may want to skip this one, otherwise, this foundation is top tier. One days that I want to go lighter coverage, I will use a pea size amount. Estée Lauder 
Double Wear Stay-in-Place 24-Hour Longwear Foundation
Color: 9N1 Ebony - the most deep with rich neutral undertones The best foundation I’ve ever used. It just works. I had a hard time finding a good foundation and I'm so glad I found this one after KVD discontinued my go to for years! Great foundation. It is definitely a medium coverage, I wasn't able to build it a lot on my skin even with a primer. I like how the formula is light weight and it does last well on the skin however, it doesn't come with a pump? For an Estee Lauder foundation I expected more. Probably will not repurchase just because of the packaging. The best foundation I have ever used!! I have oily skin, and this is the holy grail of foundations. While I still am oily, it sits so well on the skin and has a great finish. I will say, it doesn't do the best job at blurring my large pores, but it does enough for me. I also have to be wary of how much I put on my forehead because it will accentuate my expression lines. That being said, this foundation is amazing and covers up my PIE/PIH and acne SOOOO well! I get so many compliments on how good my skin looks :) I do wish they had more fair shades, tho because while 1C0 Shell works for me in the summer-- it does not work in the winter for me! But 0N1 Alabaster is way too fair and Cool Bone doesn't work either. So I'm screwed when it comes to winter time lol. Estee Lauder fix the shade range by then, please :) I included a before picture and after (btw I have acne on my chin in both pics!) After trying tons and tons of foundations, BB and CC creams, I landed on this one and have been using it for over a year now. 

It provides good coverage but doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. 

I’ve had problems in the past with makeup looking cakey, separating, and highlighting texture imperfections. None of that with this formula.

I literally don’t even care to look at other foundations. This is it. I love it! I personally only use it for my under eye and any imperfections — basically using it as a concealer — but I have tried it full face and it’s great! It indeed DOES stay in place once it dries! I am usong this product since 5 years, daily. It is a full coverage foundation, however it is not getting heavy on the face. It is easy to apply, and build on top. Absolutely not worth the money, I’d much rather use Walmart foundation. Sinks into my pores, makes me look cakey, all around terrible coverage. Very upset with the results. Feels like you opened a can of paint and smells like it. If you are looking for a “natural” look I wouldn’t bother. I pay a lot in skin care and feel like over time the chemicals that make it “water proof “ will show eventually Terribly dry. Unless your face is extremely! oily  I do not recommend.   Returned product happy with return policies This product does not lie it stays. It holds my makeup nicely and keeps a good texture on my skin even after hours of wear and in the heat. I am also very fair skinned and its a great shade for me. She's a staple now. This one is a classic for a reason! It's what I always come back to when I want all-day, complete coverage, and it always delivers. Even though this has been around for a while, it wears very much like a BB or CC cream -- lightweight, not drying. I have mild rosacea on my chin and cheeks, and this evens out my skin tone. It also lives up to its name, lasting all day. The biggest downside is that it doesn't include SPF (as far as I know -- I'm assuming that if it did, that would be included in the label). But with all the great SPFs available now -- I'm partial to Supergoop -- that's a relatively easy fix. 

So Estee Lauder delivers with this one! I tried using a different foundation after years of using this. I couldn’t do it. Tried tested and true Best full coverage foundation for a matte look; used this for cheerleading and it would not budge My go to foundation.  Light weight and melts into my skin.  No matter the other foundations I try I always come back to this one. I’ve been using this product for 2 years now and love it. I live in Florida and in the summer heat with sweating and the humidity- I cannot believe this stays on my face even with dabbing sweat off. I found the perfect color match, love the longevity of it. Easy application and the bottle lasts a good amount of time. The only con is you have to pay $13 extra for the pump cap, it’s not included which I think is silly. Prior to this foundation I was using NARS soft matte and while I enjoyed the formula I couldn’t get a perfect color match and it oxidized so much. You could clearly see where the foundation ended on my neck. I don’t have that problem with this, it’s blends so beautifully and the color match is spot on. I absolutely love this foundation, I have always struggled with foundations from them either causing me to break out to being too dry/ oily or separating.  This has been one of the only foundations that’s perfectly what it claims to be! Love the coverage of this foundation but at the end of the day, it settles into my pores and just looks bad.  It’s a matte finish which hasn’t been the best for my mature skin.  I wanted to love it but at the end of the day it just doesn’t work for me. The perfect full-coverage foundation I was looking for.
I’m used to wearing Armani Luminous Silk, but I wanted something with more coverage for certain occasions. This foundation absolutely delivered. While the shade range could use improvement the color match wasn’t perfect the formula itself is exceptional. I wore it while walking around New York City in 90° heat all day, and it did not budge. It looked flawless from morning to night. Love!! Actually lasts 24 hours it’s insane how this just does not budge. It’s hard to remove, you definitely need a good cleansing balm. Anyone saying it’s cakey is not applying it correctly. Light layers on hydrated skin This foundation is incredibly good at staying on, even for over 24 hours. Even if my skin gets touched, rubbed, or some water gets on it— no change in appearance. Builds very well, I mainly use it as a concealer. Comes off easily with my cleanser soo good super build able and doesn’t feel too heavy and doesn’t break me out it’s super nice on the skin This base left me disappointed, nothing like the one I bought three years ago, it seems FAKE. I love this foundation, I use it as concealer, although it kinda smells like paint, but other than that it’s amazing! So I've basically been using this since I was a teen. It's probably been a decade, and it's the only foundation I like. I havent tried too many to be fair, but I prefer it to most mainly because it doesnt make me break out. I will say like maybe if you're applying too much it might feel cakey. I find a little goes a long way with this. Just hate the price increase bc I used to get this for 50 bucks as a teen LOL. I have tried other foundations (ex: tir tir, huda) but end up coming back to this one. Regrettably this product made me breakout so bad in tiny white pimples full of white guck that took weeks to get my face back to normal. I barely breakout and have clean skin but I used this product two days in a row and broke out badly. I really tried to like it but I’ll just have to cut my losses and search for another foundation. I tried this product because it was so highly recommended for full coverage and oily skin. I prepped my skin like I normally do. The second I put it on, I felt like it did not blend well and felt cakey. I was very aware I was wearing makeup. Originally, I wanted to try it and see how it wore over time. I couldn't stand it on my skin and washed if off within 30 minutes and I am glad I did. I had a reaction to it and my cheeks had a rash that was red and raised. I do not have sensitive skin so I was shocked I had this reaction. Returned it as quickly as possible. Great for oily skin/ fully coverage look. Gives the smoothest base!!!! The coverage is great and it covers my redness well. For my wedding day it was great, but I did a TON of skin prep and dermaplaned. On an average day, I feel like this foundation shows a lot of texture. I’ve tried many different foundations for full coverage and I MUST say that this foundation has met ALL of my expectations!! The shade is PERFECT for my skin tone and it’s full coverage and The best foundation. I’ve been using it for over 7 years now. I am extremely pale with an olive undertone, and while this is pretty light, it has a more peachy undertone instead of being neutral so it’s not quite a perfect match. It is matte and not too thick, and it is relatively transfer proof. Would be great for cool undertones or slightly darker skin tones. This is the best foundation if you have acne prone or oily skin. Absolutely amazing coverage and stunning finish. 10/10 This product said that stay for 24 hours but sincerely after 4 hours make up goes away ! Best foundation I’ve ever used. Complete a color match, and they will find the best shade for you. I’ve been using this product for over 7 years now, and will never switch. I have combination skin, with my forehead being pretty oily, but I don’t have to use any matte powder with this product. I always get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it! This foundation is BY FAR the best foundation I have ever tried. The shade match is insane; it's also super dewy and hydrating. Worth how expensive it is. I absolutely love this product! It’s creamy with full coverage but cakey. I have worn this foundation for years!  It lasts all day! Product stays-in-place and offers very good coverage. This is my first bottle of the Double Wear, after using the Double Wear Sheer for several years.  Overall, I preferred the sheer, but it's been discontinued, so here we are.  Things I like:  I do love that the colors are the same across both foundations, and that they really ARE the same.  I kept my same color, and it's just as good as it always was.  Things that I don't love:  (a) this is not as smooth and easy to spread as the Double Wear Sheer was.  It's workable, but not nearly as easy to apply; (b) I do not like the glass bottle at all.  The plastic squeeze bottle was easier to manage, easier to dispense the product, and easier to travel with.  Also, unbreakable ~ a bonus in the bathroom where many of us apply makeup.  The glass bottle doesn't lend itself to easy application with a brush, a sponge, your fingers....nothing really.  Overall, it's workable, and I'm not likely to change.  But I do question why those of us who used the Double Wear Sheer are forced to convert to the heavier Double Wear, or change product lines/manufacturers altogether. I love this product at 54. Tried other brands but I do t get the coverage or long lasting. I have been using this foundation for more than 5 years. The coverage is perfect, not oily and goes on smoothly. I don't have breakouts and it's worth the price. A little goes a long way. My favorite product - double wear foundation from Estée Lauder. I am crazy of it. 🩷 This goes on smooth and has great coverage! Love it! This is by far the very best foundation I've used. It's easy to apply and blends well. I tend to sweat a lot and it stays in place. It didn't settle into my wrinkles either. I'm glad I spent my money on this! I have worn this for years!!! Ive gone to other brands just go be wasting money because once you've had the best you just won't settle for less. For those of you questioning whether you should try it. Go!!! You won't regret it. No matter youre skin type. It will help you. All day and into the night. It really is THAT good. This is the first time I've used this makeup, and I really like it — the color is perfect, it feels very smooth, provides good coverage, and is lightweight. The only thing I'm concerned about is that the bottle seemed to be only a little more than half full when I opened it. It looked like it might have been used, even though it came in the original box. I'm wondering if this is how it normally comes, or if I might have received one that was previously used. Could you please clarify this for me? Thank you I switched to Estée Lauder probably 10 years ago now, and I have loved their products from the start. The Double Wear foundation stays in place, isn't cakey, and has a smooth finish. Even though I struggled finding my right shade 5w1.5, this foundation is amazing!!! A little goes a long way and it is very light on the face.Did I mention that the coverage is perfection!!! Definitely on my top 3 repurchase list.
Wish there was a color a little darker than 5w1.5, but light than 6w1. My sister raved about this foundation for years but, it took until I was in my 60's to try. I will never use anything else going forward. Looks beautiful even on mature skin. Lasts all day without settling into lines. Glasses do not leave a mark and it really is transfer resistant. Try a sample and you wont regret. There is a reason it is #1. I don't usually wear a matte foundation but decided to try this for a better coverage.  I really like this foundation a lot.  It blends in well and the color Fresco was perfect for my fair-to-medium complexion. I used the ""Foundation Finder"" tool to find my color. I like that it gave several suggested colors to choose from. It was also my birthday and Estee sent a very nice 3-piece birthday gift as well. I would purchase this product again. I have been using this foundation for over 10 years and love it so much! I have recieved so many compliments on my skin and I know it's because of this foundation! It has great coverage, but be sure to shake it before use. It covers redness well. very dissatisfied with the quality! The price is huge - there is no quality. The foundation gets into all the pores, emphasizes them. You can see all the peeling on the skin. The bottle is absolutely awful. The product just flows out of it when the lid is closed. Is this luxury quality? I have been wearing Estee Lauder for years and love it. The coverage is great and it matches my skin tone so you don't see a makeup line around the jawline. It stays on most of the day and I don't feel like I'm wearing makeup. I received this product for free from ESTEE LAUDER for testing and review purposes.Its really good for skin around eyes. I've been wearing Estee Lauder for decades. When they discontinued the Double Wear light line, I was so disappointed. I have a complexion that needs to be evened out, but I like it to be soft and not look like I have a mask on my face. I switched to the full coverage Double Wear foundation, and I have never looked back! A little goes a long way and my face always looks completely flawless. I constantly get compliments of how perfect my complexion looks, and that it nearly looks like I'm not wearing foundation! Ben using since I was in my 20's. I'm now 50.  Like others I've noticed a change in the way my foundation sits on my skin lately also.  I settles into my pores and every single wrinkle.  If I don't use powder to diffuse it, it doesn't look at all like it used to.  And I can't do that all the time because my face is on the dry side.  Also, I used to love that my foundation had an SPF in it.  What the heck happened to it???  Why chance such a good thing? I know, you'll maintain you did NOT change the formula.  Well, at least explain where the spf went?  If you didn't change the formula, how did the SPF disappear? I'm a 66 yr old outdoor woman with oily skin. I live in a dry climate with temperatures ranging from-40 to 100 degrees so I need 2 makeup sets; winter and summer. Getting the makeup formula right is always a challenge. Summer sunscreen causes a slicky mess. Powder makeup disappears after an hour. In the winter, water based moisturizer doesn't allow powders to adhere. I bought this yesterday in anticipation of the cooler temperatures. It blends nicely and bonds to my skin. I prefer a sheer makeup so the coverage is more than what I normally use but the look is so natural, it looks great. I've used high end French and Italian brands and this Double Wear is just as excellent. Maybe better because it's scent free. This foundation is light, creamy, and stays put all day and all year round. From cold, dry, winters, to hot, humid summers. I have used this foundation for over 15 years. I am 50+ white (Hispanic ethnicity). I used it when I had oily to combination skin and now have dry/combination skin. It never disappoints. LIght enough to not feel heavy, but full coverage to cover any tone imperfections. I use a lighter color in the cooler months and as my skin tans in the warmer months I use a darker color. I will be a customer for life! Don't worry about the price, you won't regret this purchase, and you'll buy it again.
The coverage is crazy! Even for people who don't  want to do makeup regularly, you ll need this as part of your routine. For me, it's an ""all-in-one"" This foundation is everything! The Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Makeup delivers full, natural-looking coverage that truly lasts all day—through heat, humidity, and long hours. I love how lightweight it feels on my skin while still giving that polished, matte finish. A perfect foundation for the natural look For years, double wear has been the only foundation I used because it was the only foundation that did not budge on my oily face. I recommended it to everyone, the staying power was amazing & life changing for me. In the past few months, I've noticed an incredible difference in the way this foundation holds up. I thought Initially I bought An old or expired bottle but unfortunately, 3 bottles later, I'm so disappointed to come to the conclusion they made a change to the formula. I'm not the only one who's experiencing this difference and Estée Lauder is gaslighting its customers and telling us they didn't change the formula. On the hunt for a new holy grail. Please delete/disregard. This product used to be amazing, very long wear and very natural finish. I have been using it for years. Now recently I have to buy a new one and the new one definitely have different formula. It is no longer long wearing, my face bacomes patchy ang foundation sit into my pores, and it pills with a lot of skincare products. I can only hope they bring the old formula back. But if it's for environmental friendly purpose, you are loosing the consumers and it's not worth it. I have been using this for years though, have changed the shade from time to time. I like the coverage and it stays so well. t.I was looking for a long-lasting foundation and have discovered that this one is the best. I have tried many other powders and liquids, but I always find myself returning to Estée Lauder, especially for special occasions when I need a foundation that looks great and lasts all day. I claimed DW foundation is the best one I have used.It could stay all days in summer.I will recommend it to my friends. That's a great choice! Estée Lauder's Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation is the best for me since I have oily skin and it keeps my skin shine-free for 24 hours. This was gifted by Estée Lauder for free in exchange for my honest review. I love the Estée Lauder Double Wear Concealer! It stays on all day without caking, blends easily, and looks great under my foundation. It is an excellent foundation.It is very suitable for me and could last for several  hours without smudging. I've been using Estée Lauder Double Wear for years and have always loved it for its flawless, long-lasting coverage. But something has definitely changed recently—and not for the better.

This new version settles into my pores, makes me look tired by the end of the day, and lacks the smooth, polished finish I used to rely on. I truly hate the way my makeup looks now. It feels too sheer, too oily, And wears off unevenly, and highlights every flaw. I didn't change anything else in my routine, and yet it feels like a completely different foundation.

To make it worse, I just bought two bottles thinking I was stocking up on my holy grail. Now they're going to waste. I also noticed the bottle no longer says SPF on it, which just adds to the disappointment.

I have no idea what I'll switch to now, but I'm heartbroken that this trusted favorite has changed so much. An excellent foundation product that lasts for 8 hours without smudging, is sufficiently moisturizing without being sticky, and nourishes my skin. It is one of my favorite products that I will keep repurchasing. I have been a prolong wear kinda girl since I started wearing makeup!! I am a ONE and DONE kinda girl, I DON'T like to have to reapply!! I started with MAC, which had GREAT long-wear makeup and lipstick, etc., but nowadays their long-wear does NOT measure up!!  I've tried ALL other brands!!  I have combo skin, even at 61, so having a long lasting makeup is SO important to me!! !  I have come back to this brand MANY TIMES because the others just don't work!! I decided to try this after seeing Nia Long's post on IG about how great the product was. After some research, I loved the expansive color palette suited for a variety of skin tones. After using another brand that discontinued my foundation after decades, I gave this a shot and became a forever fan. It blends in flawlessly and works well with my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. The best part about this foundation is the range of shade choices. I'm surprised how irritated my eyes get at the end of the day with this foundation. It causes my eyes to water throughout the day as well. This is the first foundation I've used that has irritated my eyes. Estée Lauder is overpriced for how irritating their products are to my skin. I thought I would be able to replace my Origins makeup with Estee makeup since they're sister companies, but I guess the wonderful days of Origins makeup are forever behind us. Since I payed so much for this foundation I impulsively bought Maybelline Fit Me foundation for my winter color to save money and it's surprisingly way better than this double wear at a fraction of the price. Go figure. It stands true to what it says but.. once on and dried and ready to finish with bronzer, blush and high lighter. It's very hard to blend those. While blending the blush it takes the foundation right off. I do everything the product details require so I am not sure how to blend other make up like bronzer or blush on top of this foundation. Been using it for 3 years and love it This product was complimentary from esteelauder. I really liked it! It applied very nicely and blended like a dream. There was no smearing or cracking. The color was maybe a little dark for me, but I'd would otherwise totally recommend it! The applicator is ideal! It's shaped just right for the eye area without leaving too much marks, and it holds just the right amount of product. It glides easily over the face, leaving a natural finish that lasts all day. Highly recommended for daily use as it doesn't damage the skin at all. Absolutellyyyy obsessed with this product. It works amazing and seamlessly. Provides complete coverage without looking dry. And the price is amazing as well. Don't sleep on this. Buy asap. Complimentary from esteelauder I got Estée Lauder double wear stay in place concealer complimentary from skeepers and Estée Lauder in exchange of my honest reviews. I really like this concealer as it blends easily into my skin and gives perfect coverage especially under eyes. Complimentary from esteelauder, this is one of the best concealers I have used. It's full coverage but with a lightweight fill and it lasts all day. I like how I could just throw this on for every day make up look for either a full glam or soft glam. I think it's also perfect for a no makeup make up routine as well. I used to LOVE this foundation. It was perfect for my oily acne prone skin. It was thick and full coverage. This new formula is very sheer and no longer nice and thick. It just slides off the face. I'm disappointed and now I have to look for a new foundation 😢 I love this foundation for my sensitive, oily and rosacea skin, for me it is the best ! It has precious finish , long lasting and smooth texture 
Thank you Estée Lauder 
I have been using it for many years and it is the best ever I have been using this product for years it's the absolute best to cover up imperfections I have been using these products for over 15 years and it is still an awesome product I've worn this foundation for years and the most recent bottle I purchased must be a new formula.  It has been looking very mask-like, settling into pores and creases and looking extremely cakey.  I'm so disappointed as this has been my HG foundation for a long time.  Can someone tell me if the formula changed or why it is no longer sitting on my face well? Look no further! This foundation is absolutely terrific. I am a natural redhead and trying to find a foundation that matches my complexion is a nightmare. I used the ""Foundation Finder"" tool and ended up with the best color match I've ever had!! The foundation is flawless and actually agrees well with my touchy skin.  Absolutely LOVE! The Estée Lauder foundation offers impeccable coverage with a lightweight feel, blending seamlessly for a natural, radiant finish. Its long-lasting formula keeps skin flawless all day, making it a must-have in my beauty routine. The Estée Lauder foundation offers impeccable coverage with a lightweight feel, blending seamlessly for a natural, radiant finish. Its long-lasting formula keeps skin flawless all day, making it a must-have in my beauty routine. Really great product! This product is very suitable for me, and my friends are also using it. Best foundation ever It is very long-lasting to use, but the dry skin may not be very suitable. The color shade is great. This would be great for oily skin not for normal or dry skin. It's a very light weight no moisturizing formal. Made my skin dry and patchy This is one of my favorite concealers on my vanity! I love that it provides medium to buildable full coverage and does a great job covering my stubborn dark circles. The finish is natural-matte—not too dry or cakey on my combination skin. The formula is lightweight, blends out smoothly, and doesn't feel heavy.  Gifted by Estée Lauder. Love this product. I have been using this for a while now and the results are noticeable. Very easy to use and creates a flawless application . Long lasting effective product . *gifted by estee lauder Estée Lauder's Double Wear Stay-in-Place 24-Hour Gifted by Esteelauder. Concealer is a game-changer for long-lasting coverage. It offers full, buildable coverage that hides imperfections, dark circles, and blemishes with a natural finish. The formula is lightweight yet powerful, blending seamlessly and staying put all day without creasing or fading. Available in a wide range of shades, it suits various skin tones, making it a reliable choice for flawless, all-day wear. I really enjoy this product: Double Wear Stay-In Place Concealer, gifted by esteelauder. I use the shade 2C (light medium cool) which is the most accurate shade match I've ever experienced.

I would agree that this provides medium coverage. That is sufficient for me as I don't have intense dark circles around my eye area. I think if you do have darker circles this in tandem with a color corrector would work quite well.

The formula is creamy and easy to apply. The applicator is a large doe foot that holds a fair amount of product. The product dries down to be matte and has a skin like finish. It blends out well into my makeup and is comfortable on my skin. I was satisfied with the longevity of the coverage but can't say for certain if it lasts 24 hours as I don't wear makeup that long…

I will say since it has a natural matte finish, it was important that I really hydrated my skin prior to applying this concealer. If I didn't it would settle a bit more into the lines on my face. Not a huge deal for me as most concealers perform much better with a fully prepped face.

The shelf life is 6 months. This gives me a bit of pause as I am not sure I can finish this all in 6 months. It would be great to have a mini one that's also half the price. 

I'd recommend this if you can find the perfect shade match as I really enjoy the formula! This is the absolute BEST foundation every. I have tried so many that clog my pores, make me look cakes, transfer or doesn't last but not this one. It gives great coverage, perfect for my oily skin. I wear it out dancing and it stays put. I'm impressed. My only regret is not knowing about this sooner. Highly recommend if you are like me and been living under a rock. I have been using Estee Lauder Double Wear since my dear friend got a job working at the Estee Lauder counter after high school.  While it was costly, my friend encouraged me to try it, as I had acne scars that needed full coverage.  I have used Double Wear exclusively now for thirty years (gulp!!!) and I can tell you that, not only does it provide the full coverage that I continue to want, my skin has aged beautifully.  I do not have the wrinkles or age spots that a lot of my friends the same age have.  My daughter tells me all the time, mom, you have not aged!  I believe this is directly because I have used Double Wear to protect my skin for so many years.  I have tried other brands, but not for long.  I always come back to Estee Lauder. Absolute perfection and I love it sooo much! Looks flawless and glided on beautifully! Gifted by Estée Lauder Double wear foundation is such a great product. Very buildable product for when I was medium to full coverage. I like to mix this with some of their repair serum and the glow primer for a more natural look with great coverage still. I can say I am OBSESSED! I've gotten my mom on the bandwagon as well. I have to say that I love this makeup! It goes on with ease. Blends completely in seconds and looks great! No greasy afterlook and flawlessly comfortable . You forget that you have makeup on. I watched a show with George Santos on out of curiousity and heard him recommend this makeup. I knew I had to try it because his community  is great with makeup . He did not disappoint. I will always wear this makeup now! The double wear foundation is the best I have ever used. I have tried many over my 70+years. Always trying ""the best"" available.The product is long lasting,always presenting a smooth foundation. I only wish I had tried Estee Lauder products years ago. I love them all. This Tawny 3W1.5 Double Wear Stay-In-Place Matte Foundation has always been my favorite. It stays on, doesn't cause shine, it covers well, and let's me build the look I want from medium to full coverage depending on when and where my game on is. It gives me the blank canvas I need to create the masterpiece of makeup that we all desire, breathable and lightweight. I LOVE this product! It blends perfectly with my skin and stays in place all day.
I will never switch! It is the best purchase I have ever made in makeup. My first order of two double wear foundations arrived and they sent me lots of gifts. I loved everything!!! Thank you very much. I will continue to be an Estée Lauder customer!!! I absolutely love this foundation! It stays put all day and night. It provides great coverage and you can layer to build the coverage. It doesn't feel heavy either. Makes my face look flawless! Love the multitude of color & tones available; sure to find your exact color match.
Great coverage that wears well all day.
Have been wearing this foundation for a couple of years now & works well for sensitive skin. This is hands down the best foundation for acne-prone skin. I have been using this for 15+ years and it does not make my acne worse due to the salicylic acid in the formula. Now that my acne season has hopefully passed, my skin continues to do well with this foundation. I prefer to wear this foundation as it keeps my skin tone even and my face oils in check. 
One downfall - purchasing through this company directly, they have terrible customer service reps. It takes 15+ minutes to get a simple question asked and with very little respect given. I love this product, but I may continue to purchase through other vendors who aren't so rude to their customers when they ask questions about the product Good coverage, lightweight and long lasting. One of my favorite products. I was shade wheat! I don't believe it till I go for shade test my self.it turned out perfect on my skin matte and bright .love it This is the best foundation for anybody who wants to not worry about having to reapply their foundation throughout the day. Last through a 12-13 hour shifts and the skin looks like a doll! I don't stick with products very often....always looking for something better. But this? I have used this makeup for so long I couldn't name it exactly...at least 20 years. And I likely will the next 20! Smooth application. Stayed all day with minimal oil. Would recommend and will buy again I have tried every foundation on the market and I am unable to find any foundation that beats Estée Lauder Double Wear. Anyone I recommend this product to tells me they have found their holy grail of foundations. It lasts all day. It covers redness and blemishes flawlessly. It doesn't settle in my wrinkles or gives that cakey look. Please Estée Lauder, don't ever discontinue this product! I wanted to write my review on the foundation as many times that I used it i got nothing but compliments I am 57 years young and half these women think that I'm lying ❤️🙂🙂 i love the way it feels on my face it's not cakey it goes on really smooth and I would not change thank you Estee Lauder keep doing what your doing Overall good product. I've been using it for a couple years. I have very oily skin and this is the best foundation I've found to not make me look shiny. Not 100% staying on all day, but I think it's more because of my skin than the product. I love the way the foundation feels on the skin. It doesn't feel like you're wearing anything. My face doesn't feel dry and it also doesn't feel or look oily. This is worth the price. It stays long and perfect. I have always hated liquid foundation and felt like my skin can't breathe. Finally, I my mid 50s with my skin needing some extra help I tried this - I used the selfie tool to select a shade which worked well.  I applied it and stared at myself, feeling like those ads that I always assume were photoshopped. My skin looked even! And smooth! And I couldn't feel it on.  I kept checking throughout the day - it still looked smooth and even all day long even though I felt like I wasn't wearing anything.  Definitely a convert. Great foundation! Stays on place for the whole day long. Good for everyday and events, but it goes better with dry-texture products. It didn't affect the quality of my skin for 4 years. Also, you need a little of the product for good coverage of the whole face and neck. My last bottle lasted for a little more than 2 years. I don't need to look any further for my perfect foundation.  I am 56, combination skin, foundations break apart on my T zone and are prone to looking cakey.  Not this one.  I apply it with a very light touch, but it still gives excellent coverage, doesn't break down, and lasts all day.  The color match I got was perfect and the foundation looks beautiful.  Definitely worth the cost. I have struggled to find a foundation that doesn't settle in my pores or look cakey at the end of the day. This foundation stays in place all day and looks just as good at 5pm as it does at 8am. I love this foundation! It's the best foundation I've been using the double wear foundation since 2019. I love that its very long lasting, has very good coverage and doesn't smudge on clothes. do love this makeup, and I do continue to purchase it in the color Ratten. Rattan is a good light-medium skin, neutral color . Although I appreciate Estée  Lauder very much over the years, when I ordered it online October  9th, it still hasn't arrived. I had to call for them to ""push it through"" as it was sitting in the warehouse for over a week with no shipping details. Now it's suddenly says it's shipped, and will be arriving October 29th. That is very late and Iam overall not happy. I and ran out, and this isn't good. It shouldn't take 20 days to get, with no weather delays whatsoever. I also live above Atlanta, and you would think it would ship faster. I highly recommend purchasing at Ulta, Dillards , Belks, or somewhere else, because Estée Lauder online  is way too slow when ordering online. There is no excuse for shipping to take this long. I would like to get my shipping fee reimbursed. I can confidently say that Estée Lauder's Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation in 6W1 Nutmeg is my all-time favorite. The shade is a perfect match for my skin tone, seamlessly blending in without any noticeable lines.

What I love most about this foundation is its versatility. I can apply a thin layer for a medium coverage look, perfect for everyday wear, or build it up with multiple thin layers for a more full coverage finish when needed. It glides on smoothly and doesn't feel heavy or cakey, which is a huge plus.

The real game-changer is its longevity. I can wear it throughout the entire day, and it still looks fresh and flawless by the time I take it off. Whether I'm at work, running errands, or out in the evening, it holds up beautifully.

Overall, this foundation offers excellent coverage, a perfect shade match, and incredible staying power. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable high quality foundation! I have been using EL foundation Fresh Air for 30+ years.  they stopped making it! so after a Chat on line I tried Futurist Anti aging. It was okay but I thought the color was too light so when I ran out I tried to purchase a deeper shade and they don't make that anymore.  So I bought Double Wear.  OMG!!  It the WORST product I have ever used.  Blotchy, flaking, lack of coverage, I look like a ghost!!.  Just awful.  Any recommendations on another product?  I thought I would go back to Futurist but no more anti-aging line.  Is the regular foundation for Futurist the same thing?  First time in all these years that I am not a happy camper with your foundations.  Bring back fresh air!! This is the best full coverage foundation..in love with this!!! Goes well for combination skin!! This is seriously so amazing foundation..in love with this 🤩 It's five stars. I was just using cheap bronzer before but my face needed a change. A friend recommended this to me and I'm so glad I purchased it. Even though it's a little on the higher side, it will last for a pretty good while. Also, you can take an other before you purchase to help decide which color is best for you, it was very accurate. Very impressed with this foundation. It literally stay all day. Great coverage with a natural look and feel. I like this foundation, it's not cakey and it doesn't come off easily. I cannot say enough how much i love this foundation. This has worked so well for my skin! Great foundation for 40+ baddies! My go to make up for life! Best make up for a great coverage I highly recommend one of my favorite products and the only foundation I will Use! i never leave reviews but this deserves one. i have been using this for yearssss & it is by far the BEST foundation i have ever used. coverage is 10/10, no transferring, LONG lasting, blends with other products well & just looks flawless all day long. oh and, it lasts a very long time too! i never leave reviews but this deserves one. i have been using this for yearssss & it is by far the BEST foundation i have ever used. coverage is 10/10, no transferring, LONG lasting, blends with other products well & just looks flawless all day long. oh and, it lasts a very long time too! This foundation is light and is full coverage. It blends well with my skin tone. Good buy, good product! I have used Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation for many years and there was a noticeable difference with this the first time I used this bottle.  The coverage was not as good and it made my eyes water.  I'm hoping this was a processing issue and I can swap for a new bottle that works. User error convinced me this was the worse foundation I've ever tried until I did some research. 
Read a review that said that if you hate this foundation you're either applying too much or not applying correctly. 
!!!That was a game changer. 

IMPORTANT- Turns out you only need a small amount and to work in small sections because it drys fast
Apply the leftover product from the sponge to your nose and forehead and chin. A thin layer here is key. 

*Lastly I ditched the primer! This stuff is full coverage and builable/ blurring enough to not necessitate Any added layers I have oily, acne scarred skin and this was the only foundation that provided full coverage, lasted for hrs without leaving my skin oily and gave me that matte finish. It kinda sucked all the oil when I applied this foundation. I loved it. I've been using it for years ! Something changed in the formula because I recently purchased a new bottle and it doesn't cover the scars. Please bring back the OLD one. Great coverage and consistency, easy to use .
Great color option ,looks very natural. I've been using this foundation for years and i refuse to use any other foundation , my absolute favorite ! I moisturized and put primer on my face before applying, after putting the foundation on, there was like white spots and didn't blend into my skin. I'm highly disappointed after spending $50 on a foundation that I can't even use, my $12 foundation does a better job than this. I thought spending more on a foundation, I would get better results but I experienced the opposite. The employees are very nice and always helpful . The best product ever!!! Must Buy This is my first time ever using this foundation and I'm loving it! The color match is flawless which is so hard to do with my olive skin. I have gotten so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks since using it too. I was told it would cover dark spots; it did not. Expensive disappointment!! For the longest time, as a woman with a deeper complexion, it's been so hard to find a foundation shade that truly matches my skin tone—let alone my undertone. Finding a perfect match where I don't have to mix two different shades has always been a struggle. This brand, however, offers such an impressive shade range that I finally found my perfect match! I was influenced to buy this, but I hate it with a deep passion. it smells like glue, applies thick and dry, becomes hard incredibly fast. does not work well under moisturizer, facial oil, or sunscreen. does not work with facial creams or cream products. is extremely difficult to work with. it provides full coverage and does not transfer, yet does not move with the skin. dries with a powdery, cemented, scaley finish that I find very unappealing. the worst foundation I ever ever tried. normal skin texture and live in the north, for reference. may work for people with thick, oily dermis. This foundation matched my skin, easy to blend & felt so lightweight to the touch. I didnt have to reapply. Spent all day outside in the Texas heat & it didn't melt off Excellent coverage I used this product long ago. That's why I bought it. Now unfortunately it is very drying. I won't ever buy again. I have a very oily face and after reading so many reviews of different products this has got to be one of my Favorite foundations that actually stays perfect to my skin and does not crack nor does it look oily and I love it!! It works amazing for me! This is my everyday foundation!! Very light weight, very natural!!! The best foundation that i ever use I really wanted to love this foundation. It has great coverage and is very long lasting but my face feels so dry when I use this. It was to  to dry and and didn't like  it   Associate was in  rush  I ask her help me find a right shade for my skin tone but she was  not helpful   What a waist of money This covers well, blends into my skin tone perfectly and lasts all day. I bet a little dewey feel from it, but I apply a little bit of translucent powder just to set it. I wear it weekly. The best coverage there is, especially for summers in the South. When on sale at Ulta, I always stock up! FINALLY, I FOUND IT.  After many trial and errors and money, I found the product that works best for my complexion. And I should add that it was with great help from the cosmetic sales lady. I've been using this foundation for almost 20 years. It has gone through at least 3 noticeable formula changes in that time. It started out as a thick, opaque, full coverage, everything-proof foundation and is now a mediocre, medium-at-best coverage, normal liquid foundation. The last two bottles I bought have oxidized in the bottle within 6-8 months, even when used with a pump immediately upon opening (so it is not exposed by the bottle opening) and being kept in a drawer. That alone will keep me from buying another. I also get oily after a few hours, even with proper prep and set. It oxidizes on my face over the course of the day and wipes off in places easily, so it looks patchy at various times as well. This just isn't the best on the market anymore and the price point is absurd for the lesser quality. I appreciate that it never causes issues for my acne prone skin and that it doesn't have a scent. The shades run very peachy and there is not a true olive shade (once it dries down and/or changes color over the day). There used to be 2 great olive shades I could wear before the last reformulation. I haven't found a proper shade since, and resorted to using a color corrector bc I thought I liked the formula. No more. I have never found a better shade match and felt so happy the day I found my shade. I love the coverage and always end up using too much because it doesn't have a pump. I have seen pumps for this on the internet and must remember to get one. You have to shake this formula to get the best out of it. It does last a really long time and it doesn't break apart. I think it's supposed to be a medium coverage and you are supposed to see your skin/freckels underneath it. I was trying to cover redness and used too much of this.
I think I used too much powder and too much foundation because I stopped using this after a few bad days with my makeup looking to heavy. I liked it better when I really prepped my skin with moisturizer and primer. If you have dryness and texture problems they can get magnified by the dry down of this formula. It's a super long lasting formula and is supposed to dry down, so it accomplishes that well. I didn't have a dewy setting spray at the time so I used what I had but I think it looks better after it's been worn for two hours or so. I think you need to be better than a beginner to use this. It needs the right supporting products to go with it. A setting spray that softens it, something like a primer to save the texture/pores you see, the right powder, and the nearly 60 shades to choose from makes it kind of tricky to use.
I tried it out because I got it on sale but I think I prefer others over this. I'm just getting back into makeup and need something a little more forgiving . This foundation is not full coverage BUT it is great for daily use. My favorite thing is that it does not transfer. I go to the gym and when I dab my face there is little to no transfer on my towels. It is also slightly mattifying. Best match to my skin and color will definitely buy again I'm in my early 30s and have a tendency to have really oily skin. It is a gift when it comes to aging but it's a curse when it comes to make up. I was using Fenty Matte foundation for years and suddenly it just kept separating and not working for me. I did some research on Reddit for oily skin and I saw people promote this product. It is amazing. I have no separation going on whatsoever and it's great coverage and easily blend with other cream makeup before it dries down. It feels like it might be a little drying, but at least I can layer on the moisturizer and not feel like I'm going to end up oily in an hour. I really recommend this to anybody that struggles with oily skin!! Worth the money! I thought I would love it but I hate it. Long wear, yeah I guess sure??? Although it just feels so dry and dull on my skin. I tried prepping my skin differently multiple times and still disappointed. I really like the coverage,  but as a 66 year old women this is giving me breakouts  of acne all over my face. I went to the Dr. and he comfered it, but over all the  it covered well and last all day. I have purchased this foundation for several years.  I love how it is a matte finish, easy to apply even with my fingers and the coverage is great!  I will continue to purchase and hope Ulta continues to stock this great 
foundation and the variety. I have been using this foundation for a couple of years now and I love this foundation! I have acne and it doesn't leave my skin feeling grease. I love the coverage it gives! It is in the spender side but totally worth it. I'm so disappointed in EL! I've worn the same Double Wear foundation for 10+ years. It went on so well and held up all day in any condition. Upon purchasing a new bottle, it didn't apply well. The foundation would instantly look cakey in areas, settling in pores and lines, and certainly did last all day. Worst of all, the new formula gives me a terrible eye irritation. I know several other long time users experiencing similar issues. Really disappointed in the new formula and left to find a new foundation after all of these years!!! I love this foundation - it gives natural looking great coverage and does not rub off.  When they say stay in place they mean it! Nothing like giving a hug and leaving your face all over someones shirt!  Won't happen with this product. I've worn this makeup for several years and have always paid retail price. It was a special delight to finally buy it from Ulta for a bargain.  I would recommend this makeup for comfort and coverage.  Thanks Ulta! A little goes a long way. It blends so well with my skin tone that it looks like I don't have any makeup on. Not a heavy formula. I hope this formula never changes. I was pleased with the results. This is the perfect foundation for me. It is smooth, has great coverage and lasts all day. Whenever i wear this foundation and a couple of other products, people want to know the make up i am wearing.  Sooo, this foundation presents well The coverage is great & feels so light. This goes on smoothly and has a beautiful finish. It lasts a long time too. Hands down the best foundation I tried this for the first time recently because it was on sale and out of frustration with my former product.  I cannot believe I have been missing out on this all these years!  It is perfect for my middle-aged but oily skin.  As previous reviews suggested, I applied with a slightly damp sponge.  The effect is very natural.  It is not a pasty matte finish, it literally just looks like my own skin, but better.  Does not accentuate pores and is the longest-lasting of all the prestige brands that I have tried.  I wouldn't go so far to say that it is ""oil-controlling"", but am very impressed with it's staying power, even after blotting.  I love it! I always re purchase this foundation. It's so good at lasting all day. Great coverage too. My new favorite ❤️ I've been using Estee Lauder since my mid 40's.  Beautiful product.  As I aged, of course I had to change the color foundation.  But once you get your moisturizer and primer on.... it's flawless.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!
, I've tried them all…and this, by far, is the best! This is the best lasting liquid foundation out there! It is buildable and full coverage, if desired. It lasts all day.   I was sweating at a football game for hours.  Standing in line for the bathroom, the woman behind me said,""How in the world is your make up still perfect?"" Thank you, Estée Lauder! Thank you, Ulta, for putting it on sale. used it for years As I get older it really hides the wrinkles Wouldn""t use anything else This is my favorite foundation and the simple fact that you had it at the price that you did was so worth it. It's not too heavy, but it foes cover well. I definitely would recommend it. If you are oily this is a perfect foundation! It lasts all day and keeps you matte and is full coverage. Downside is it has no pump, so unfortunately i returned it due to it being a hassle 
Other than that, its good I used to wear this foundation for a while up until last summer when I decided it was time for a change. I purchased it during the sale. It has drastically changed. It went on like I was painting my face with oil & remained that way all day I have been using Double Wear for many years. It gives great coverage and looks flawless. I get many compliments on my beautiful skin. What more could one hope for! The formula is perfect, not too thick or thin. Lasts all day. Wore it when my daughter got married and the coverage was there all day, indoors and out! I do have pretty dark acne scars and I do color correct first, this foundation I will most likely wear for my wedding, but It is not the most full coverage. You will need to still slightly color correct and use concealer under it. But the skin like finish and ""good"" coverage it gives makes up. I have drug store foundations that are more full coverage but doesn't give the finish this one does. I've worn this foundation off and on for many years.  It is thick, full coverage, but I have a lot of lines on my face so it can settle in those.  I use a drop of my face oil to give it a little glow and an easier spread and that has worked well for me.  My shade is 2C4 Ivory Rose, which is not available in stores and hard to find online.  I was able to purchase this during the 21 Days of Beauty and for the first time in a few years, Ulta had it in stock.  I placed my order before 6 am to ensure that I got my shade.  (In past years, I tried ordering later in the day and it was unavailable by then.)  If you need full coverage foundation, I recommend this.  One bottle lasts me about 9 months.  I recommend the pump (not included) for the correct amount.  You only need 1! I love this product. In the summer, I sweated so much because of hot flashes. You would never know because this light but double-wear foundation stayed on all day, my whole workshift. The days that I went somewhere after work until 11 pm my makeup still looked good.  I wear the color Cashew, it's like a medium light hint that helps balance my yellow undertones. The quality of the product is 100% recommended I have been using Estée Lauder for years and still
Love it. My favorite foundation! This was the first time trying this foundation.  I'm 57, so a moisturizing foundation is what I'm looking for.  This line has a ton of color choice and you will definitely find a match.  I found it to be a bit drying and by the end of day it started looking cakey and dry on my skin.  Besides that, a quality product. I love this brand Perfect for covering imperfections. Stays and last the whole day. This is truly the only foundation that stays on all day and night. Yes its pricey but worth every penny of it! I would recommend this to anyone, great foundation I love it😍😍 One of the best foundation It has beautiful coverage and everyone always tells me what gorgeous skin I have. My favorite! Might have to go one shade lighter I can't believe that I finally found my favorite foundation, after all these years!! This does NOT compare to any drug store dupes! Work in a restaurant, not only did the product go on so smooth with such coverage but it looked amazing after a 5 hour shift of running and hustling in a restaurant (including patio tables!) Shade match thanks to Ava at ulta in lincoln was spot on!!! For background, I've used Maybelline Fit Me for my fair, combination skin (minimal acne and some fine lines but overall I'm very careful with my skin) for over 5 years. But, I wanted to explore other options to see if a higher quality brand and formula might be worth it. I don't love Fit Me, but it's worked well enough. Decided to give this foundation a shot after lots of research and luckily got it on sale. But, it…was terrible. I followed the instructions, tried using it with my normal routine (after clean skin, exfoliation, sunscreen, lotion, base layer), then tried suggestions found online. Nothing worked—I kept looking cakey and so dry. The color was OK but slightly orange undertones left me uneasy wearing it on top of the application issues. I would honestly return the product if I hadn't throw the box away. I've never ran into this much of an issue with foundation before! This is my go to and works wonders. something definitely changed with this formula and I'm so disappointed. I have an old bottle from a few years back that I wanted to replace, but the difference in performance is wild. It used to be amazing for oil control and now it breaks up so easily, something it never did before. doublewear is the only foundation I used until now and I wanted to use it forever! I can't use any other foundation this is the goat foundation frfrrrr The best all day coverage without looking cakey. I'm using this for product for more then 25 years. Best ever  no lines on my face perfect 👌 shade  .. I always look like I'm not having makeup on my face .. I can swim with my makeup ..  Best foundation  waterproof  I will keep buying more  for my friends This is a versatile coverage product, would be perfect for a long lasting light to medium coverage or can be layered to build coverage. It has a very thin consistency making it difficult to cover scaring and acne marks but lasts & is rather dewy. Love this foundation! One of the only ones that holds up to my super oily skin. It doesn't bother me at all that the bottle doesn't have a pump. It is much better without. I don't waste any product! Amazing foundation. Perfect color. Lasts all day. Didn't oxidize much. Great coverage, can be used any season, all skin types I've been using this foundation for years, and haven't found anything I like better. I've tried 10+ other high-end foundations, and always come back to this one. It stays on all day without smudging, doesn't transfer, covers blemishes without looking cakey, and doesn't settle into fine lines. I use one pump for more of an everyday look, but can layer if I want more of a ""full glam"". One bottle also lasts me for months. Highly recommend! I absolutely love this foundation. It's more expensive than the one I used before but definitely worth it. Great coverage. I compared the new foundation I bought to the old one ai had. The new foundation I got is changed. Not the same texture not the same shade. I'm 38 and I tried 3 different foundations and this was the absolute best for my age highly recommend I love this foundation, covers so good and works great with my oily skin! I really like this foundation.It covers very well.It lasts all day, so it is well worth the price Love the shade.
It only takes a dab to cover your face. Love the shade.

Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Global Anti-Aging Cream,"This doesn’t absorb and makes me look really greasy. Not sure why the positive reviews. The most incredible moisturizer I’ve ever used! Very moisturizing and after using for only a short time, I’ve noticed a huge difference in how my face and neck feel and look! It’s worth every dime. I’ve been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 for a while now, and it truly feels like a little luxury in my skincare routine. The texture is rich and silky, yet it absorbs quickly without leaving my skin greasy. Right after applying, my face feels smooth, hydrated, and has a healthy glow that lasts throughout the day. I also love that it has SPF 25, so I can use it as my daytime moisturizer and know I’m getting extra protection. Over time I noticed my skin looking a bit firmer and more even, especially around the jawline and smile lines. It also works really well under makeup, almost like a primer, keeping my foundation fresh without making it cakey. The only thing to note is the fragrance – it’s noticeable, though I personally find it pleasant.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Amazing!! It’s super hydrating it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and not tacky or oily like some other skin products I would recommend highly. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. As a moisturizer it's fantastic, especially for dry skin types. Everything else is lies and falsehood!
Also another drawback, be aware that it will darken more towards orangish hue on the face and neckor whereever else it is put on the skin!  If that's not what you like, then choose wisly I've been using a lot of products for acne prone skin that have been very drying to the skin and this moisturizer is a god send!  Very hydrating and non-greasy!  I just wish the scent wasn't so overpowering!

It's perfect for daily use and works well even on sensitive skin. The formula feels gentle and refreshing, with no heavy residue. A great addition to any skincare routine! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I didn’t get the hype for this one. I didn’t see anything special changes to my skin and I didn’t notice it being ultra hydrating or anything like that. The added spf was nice but spf 30 would have been better. I don’t think it is worth the high price tag. For reference I have dry skin. 

I received this product for free from Topbox marketing for testing and review purposes. It was moisturizing, but that’s about it. I am really disappointed and did not see any changes in my skin. For the price tag I expected something special. I even think the added spf broke me out a bit (although I have extremely sensitive skin) I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This cream feels like a silky hug for my skin. The texture is rich without being heavy, and it sinks in beautifully without leaving a greasy finish.

It goes on smoothly and feels very moisturizing on the skin. I love how it combines hydration with sun protection. After applying, my skin feels soft, hydrated and plum throughout the day. I’m beyond impressed with this moisturizer! I received this product for free from TopBox Circle for testing and review purposes. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème for a few weeks now, and I'm genuinely impressed. The texture is rich yet lightweight, absorbing quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It leaves my skin feeling deeply moisturized, smooth, and noticeably firmer. There's a subtle, luxurious scent that adds to the overall experience without being overpowering.

What stands out the most is how radiant and plump my skin looks after consistent use. It feels like my skin has more bounce and elasticity, and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softer. It also works well under makeup, providing a smooth base without pilling.

I have also noticed major improvement to my skin since I started using this. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Great product, it has very thick texture so if you have oily skin I wouldn’t recommend it. But for dry skin it’s amazing, very moisturizing and has spf which is always a plus.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I love this cream!!! This cream is very hydrating, light weight and it genuinely feels amazing on the skin.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I received this product from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I love this moisturizing cream so much; it blends well into my skin and does not feel greasy, leaving my skin looking so beautiful. recommend to everyone. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 Moisturizer for about 3.5 weeks, and while it's too early to see significant changes (the brand recommends 12 weeks for optimal results), I've already noticed some great benefits. My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays
Keep in mind that everyone's skin type is different, so your experience may vary. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing how it works for me in the long run. 
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Awesome product, a little greasy feeling when you first put it on, but it soaks into the skin good. I love this Estée Lauder moisturizing cream!
I've been using it for over a week now, and it’s incredibly hydrating which is perfect for my dry skin. One of the things I enjoy most is how well it blends with my foundation or skin tints. It doesn't feel heavy at all, which is a big plus. It also has a light, pleasant fragrance that I personally like. While I’ve only used it for a short time, I’m hopeful it will deliver the long-term, youthful benefits it promises. So far, it’s been a great addition to my skincare routine!
 
I received this product free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I gave this to my mother to try it out and so far she said it is good. Though she thinks with prolonged use it will help with her skin more. She has also mentioned it is lightweight on her skin and is not heavy which she likes. Definitely recommend. This moisturizer feel reach and smooth on the skin it keeps my face hydrated all day and adds a nice glow I like that it has SPF 25 for sun protection it also works well under makeup the scent is a bit strong but overall it’s a good great product great product I’ve been using this cream for a while, and my skin does feel hydrated. It has a sunscreen-like texture, which I’m not a fan of, but it’s not that bad. I think it’s a nice product to add to a morning routine, and I would recommend it.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Thick product. Scented. A good product to put on overnight and let soak into skin I absolutely loved this moisturizer! I usually break out when I try new products on my face but it didn’t happen with this one. This product is very moisturizing and also has spf in it which is amazing! I loved this and will be purchasing again ! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I love that  it leaves my skin hydrated while also improving firmness. It absorbs well, softens fine lines, and leaves my skin looking  more youthful. It is a bit pricey it is worth the splurge.l got this product for free from Topbox circle  in exchange for my honest review Packaging is luxurious; the texture is bouncy yet feels light on the skin. I appreciate that it is not very strongly scented. After a few days of use I feel my skin is smoother, softer and more supple. Will continue to use to see if I can prevent more wrinkles. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. A lot of product in container. Goes on very thick. It’s really scented, which could cause me problems in future. As a mom in my 30s, Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème SPF 25 has been a game-changer. It hydrates, firms, and gives my skin a radiant glow—while also protecting it with SPF. Feels luxurious, but absorbs quickly, and fits perfectly into my busy routine. Love that it does so much in one step! I’ve been using this product for around 2 weeks and it has become a staple in my skincare routine. It’s a lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I highly recommended. This product was given by Topbox Marketing for reviewing purposes. I have been using this product for the past two weeks and am pleased with the product. My face feels moisturized, without feeling oily. My skin feels firmer and hydrated.

Ive been testing this moisturizer out for the last couple of weeks and it's great! It's a super rich thick formula which I love but someone with oily skin may find it too heavy. There is also a sent with this product. It's a light sunscreen sent which my skin doesn't seem to mind at all! I love the added bonus that theres SPF 25 in the moisturizer for days that I forget to put my sunscreen on. Overall a great product! A luxury moisturizer that instantly enhances & improves your appearance. The quailty and texture of the Estee Lauder revitalizing moisturizer is truly unmatched. While I have been using this product, my skin feels and looks like Ive been aging backwards. My skin is more even, pores have minimized, fine lines reduced next to nothing & my skin is tighter and so smooth. My skin no longer feels and looks dull. My skin looks youthfully radiant, healthy, & hydrated. The product absorbs smoothly, and feels so good on my skin. Because of the high quality ingredients a little goes a long way when applying it. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. The texture is rich but sinks in effortlessly, leaving my skin soft and refreshed. After a few days, I noticed a visible glow and firmness. It layers well under makeup and feels super nourishing.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I absolutely love Estee Lauder.  I normally wear their Resilience Multi-Effect Moisturizer Tri-Peptide Face and Neck Creme SPF 15, however I'm finding it a little heavy for Spring/Summer.  This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.  I still stick with my Resilience Multi-Effect Night cream on top of my Advanced Night Repair serum.  
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. WOW🤩 the texture of this cream is just A DREAM! Its thick but soft, can feel how protects my skin, leaving this light barrier. Hydrates so good, I’ve been using it everyday. ** I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. After using this moisturizer for a week, I'm very impressed! It has a rich creamy texture that hydrates so well without leaving my skin greasy! I use this as a day cream and night cream and the hydration and softness lasts all day! I love how radiant my skin looks after using this and my makeup applies beautiful on top of this. I'm rather picky when it comes to moisturizers and this is a winner! It gives my skin luminosity and a lifted look! Highly recommend! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. ⭐ Rating: 5/5

I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for a few weeks now, and my skin is obsessed. It’s rich but not heavy, melts in beautifully, and gives me that soft, bouncy feel with zero greasiness. The hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day, and I’ve noticed my skin looks smoother and more radiant—like I actually got 8 hours of sleep. Perfect under makeup, too. Total glow-up in a jar!

Would absolutely repurchase.✨ I received this from #topbox and Estee Lauder 
The cream is nice and creamy. My skin is so dehydrated that I need that extra moisture daily. I used it at night, and my face felt so soft. Let's hope in time the results are going to be noticed. I received this product for free from Topbox for review and testing purposes.
I absolutely love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft, smooth, and hydrated. Since I started using it, I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant. The hyaluronic acid delivers a great hydration boost without making my skin feel greasy. Highly recommend! I have received this product from Topbox, the cream is thick and slightly oily and also have fragrance. I have applied it during the night and day, as I have combination skin I felt it was oily and it will works better for me in winter than in summer. But I will continue to use in the night and I like the texture of the moisturizer. It would be good if the product does not have any fragrance. One this I like about the product is on applying, it gets absorbed into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave any white cast like the regular sunscreen. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I can't say much. However, I have really sensitive skin, and when I use it, no irritation or breakouts. Which is very important to me as I have crazy reactions to products I recieve this product for free from topbox for review and testing purpose.Love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight and leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and hydrated. I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant since using it. The hyaluronic acid gives a great hydration boost without feeling greasy. Definitely a new favorite! I can’t believe I’ve only just discovered this moisturizer. First of all, it has SPF 25, which is a huge bonus, especially for those quick moments I am out for a short period of time, when I forget sunscreen. Knowing my skin is protected even during those times is such a relief.
As a moisturizer, it’s absolutely divine. It glides on like silk, feels luxurious, and leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. The scent is subtle but lovely—clean and elegant, not overpowering.
Also, I worry about breakouts when trying new products and none at all for this. My skin has been loving this. I use it every morning, and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day without getting greasy.
I’m genuinely so happy with this purchase and already planning to restock once I run low. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new moisturizer.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I have found my new staple. I love how it has spf along with a great moisturization.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This product has a very soft baby touch like consistency. It smells like sunscreen and is in a very nice container. When I put it on my skin it blended into my skin very seamlessly it does seem to have a white cast when you blend it in but with a lot of blending it disappears right away! I received this for free from TopBox circle marketing. This moisturizer is a dream. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and looks noticeably firmer and more radiant. The texture is luxurious, absorbing beautifully without any greasiness. Plus the added SPF 25 is fantastic for daily protection. It's truly a powerhouse for youthful, healthy-looking skin.I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. If you have sensitive skin, this is not the product for you.  This creme had a strong fragrance and was very irritating to my skin.  After one use, I developed a severe puritic rash that was uncomfortable.  It took about 2 weeks to resolve after needing to use a typical steroid. i used my points for a sample and it broke my face out bad...thing is not much breaks my out so I was surprised Hydration and Results From the first use, my skin felt instantly hydrated and softer. Over a few weeks, I noticed a more plumped appearance and a slight reduction in fine lines. It’s deeply nourishing without clogging pores, making it a good choice for people with normal to dry skin. For those with very oily skin, it might feel a little too heavy. It’s a nice moisturizer, but frankly I’ve used better for less money. Not worth the money. It’s a thick cream in texture but I don’t find it very moisturizing. 
I’d stick with Clarins. I received this product in error from Sephora and am glad I did. I am 49 and my skin looks dehydrated after 2 hours of using anything. I put on my SPF, this moisturizer and then Tatcha Dewy Skin Mist and my skin (picture below) is plump and dewy 7 hours after application! I had a disappointing experience with this face cream. Unfortunately, I reacted poorly to it, resulting in significant swelling around my eyes and hives all over my face. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product. I received a sample of this and immediately bought a full size, amazing for mature skin- the scent is pleasant and does not bother me at all. I'm using the sample and already see results. will definitely buy full size. I just received it today and as a woman who suffers from migraines I cannot stand the perfume smell. It is suffocating. It’s not a natural “we’ve mixed all these wonderful ingredients to make your skin great” it’s a bottle of perfume in lotion form that will dry your skin because of it! This product did just nothing. Very overpriced. Smells really good but nothing more to say. Worst porches i ever had Every time I washed my face and using this I broke out Unfortunately this product irritated my skin. it's hit and miss when my skin reacts to products. after application within a couple hours, it started as a tingle and then started burning. Definitely not the product for me. I never write reviews but I got this in a holiday set back in Dec. I just finished using the product and had to repurchase. It’s now a staple. My skin has never felt so soft!! This came in the Advanced Night holiday set from Estee Lauder that was an INCREDIBLE value. I have tried this particular product several times now and it's just meh. Lackluster. I wouldn't recommend or purchase. Absolutely love the results of this product but the fragrance is a deal breaker. Why do they have to do that!! My face has never felt or looked better but even the slightest smell gives me a headache and you can smell it come out when you work out which ends up burning my eyes I've used this for year off and on. And will probably keep going back to it. lol It's one of the only creams that actually hydrate my super dry skin. My only gripe is the scent. Smells like old lady perfume, which I suppose is expected from an older brand like Estee Lauder. The only comparable face cream I have found is the Tacha Dewy Face Cream (Which smells soooo much better. Very light, refreshing scent.). So I flip-flop between the two. I had over 100 points I decided to try this moisturizer wow!!! Leaves my face like a baby !!! Now i see why the bigger size is expensive but its worth it leaves my skin so smooth love it!!! Been using since my 20’s so it’s been a little more than a decade. Clearly looks like I’m in my 20’s when I’m not. so I’m a loyal loyal user. Celebrity brands come and go, but this creamy delicious cream is a forever in my routine for the rest of my life. I’m obsessed ￼with this! I use it in the morning , it makes your skin so soft and buttery goes perfect under spf and drunk elephant bronze drops. My skin overall is much plumper and smooth. I got a sample of this moisturizer and I am in love. It feels so nice, smells nice and really moisturizes my skin. After using this product over the last week, I can say it’s definitely not for me. I got the mini size with my points so I’m glad I was able to trial it. I’ve got really clear skin and it broke me out. The smell is nice but I’m not a fan of scents in my skincare. It feels really nice and luxurious on my skin. I use the Sephora skincare which is clean and I absolutely love it, will be sticking with that. I love this cream. It is silky smooth and combined with my anti-aging serum of choice, this face cream is wonderful. I received this as a sample.  It was mid winter, my hands were red, chapped and splitting from what I've no clue.  I used this on them once and they were healed within the hour.  My face is way to sensitive for me to put anything on it, but this is fabulous if you have painful red winter hands. Perfect moisturizer for my sensitive, fair, dry skin, lasts all day, winter and summer. No dry patches. No reactions. The scent is subtle. Skin is visibly smoother, more plump and radiant. 5stars This is a great moisturizer but the biggest issues for me were the fragrance which lasts a while and that it’s irritating to my eyes especially if I sweat later in the day. I think Rose Ingleton’s moisturizer is a great frangance free alternative especially if you want a moisturizer with less fragrance I have dry, pigmented skin, and this has worked wonders. Literally gives me a filter effect. ￼ I got this as a complementary gift when I ordered mascara from Estée Lauder. It is over the top when it comes to fragrance. It goes on thick, but does not hydrate. Not a fan whatsoever. I use it on my legs now My combination skin love this stuff so far and gives a nice silky smooth feel. So far so good. I liked this moisturizer and it made my skin dewy and supple. However, it was a little too thick for me, especially during the summer months. Better for winter or very dry skin, probably. Overall very nice and smells good too!
I received this product complimentary in exchange for a fair review. Lovely cream that moisturizes and brightens my complexion! This moisturizer is a good option.  I received a free sample to test out and review from influenster. I am not sure of the long term impact but short term, I’ve had good results.  It’s a thicker formula so I found myself using a little more product but it’s a rich, hydrating formula. It is scented and isn’t my favorite scent (perfumed scent) but it does dissipate pretty quickly.  This works best when washed before each time you apply. I break out pretty easily but this didn’t break me out which is great. I loved the texture of this moisturizer. When applying it to my skin, I felt that it went on super smooth. Despite being a cream type, it absorbed completely into my skin without any greasiness. I have combination skin and this seemed to help with some of the dry patches that sometimes pop up from time to time. In addition, the scent was light and refreshing - a winning combination. Let me start by saying that I am not one to splurge on beauty products unless I hear AMAZING things about it. So let me just tell you that after testing a sample of this product for a couple of weeks, I am ready to splurge on the full size product!!

My skin is definitely showing signs of “maturing” at forty years old. I have tried a lot of products over the past few years, both high end and drug store (you know the drug store brand commercials…”better than the $100 cream”). Truth be told, none of the products I have tried for my maturing, combination skin, have blown me away. That is, until this little baby came along. It’s weightless, and makes your skin feel soooo smooth. I love that it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I am definitely noticing a decrease in fine lines.

If you are showing signs of aging skin, give this product a try! I received a small sample of Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I loved using this moisturizer! It's thick and luxurious and felt great on my oily skin. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this moisturizer. I used this mostly in the AM for a little over a week. It is lightly scented but that didn't bother me. I can't speak to the long-term benefits since I only used this for a short time but I would love to continue using this moisturizer! I love Estee Lauder, it works perfectly for my skin, I never had any problems or issues with this brand. The moisturizer is great, now that the air got soooo dry in Texas, I must have a good moisturizer. I apply it ok face and neck, in the morning and at night. The skin feels good, as it feels very dry after washing it. I received a sample of this in exchange for an honest review. It was too small to see the long term effects of the product, but I definitely noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin looked and felt. I tend to get very dry when the weather starts to get colder but this definitely helped keep that at bay. I thought the event was light and really nice, and I am usually sensitive to heavily scented products. I especially love that a refill pot is available to save on packaging waste. The packaging is lovely has has a luxe look to it as well. Love this! My skin gets very dry in cold weather and I noticed a huge difference with only 1 use. A little goes a long way and it’s definitely moisturizing. I received this from moisturizer for free from Estēe Lauder and Influenster. Unfortunately when I began to use it I broke out. It has a light fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly. It has a creamy texture that goes onto the skin beautifully. I would have to try it again to see if it continues to cause breakouts. I liked it so much that I used it completely in a week.  I liked how it left my face soft and hydrated.  It has a super soft texture that does not leave the skin greasy.  its aroma is also super light.  Too bad it was a very small sample.  but I am happy to have tried it for sure I will buy it later.  highly recommended.  I really liked the packaging, both the material and its color make it look very elegant. I was excited to try this item. It did not have a oily look or texture. It was easy to use and after a few days I felt that I could see a change with some of my face wrinkles. I loved this product, after using only few days i started to notice changes on my skin. It made my skin to feel firmer and started vanishing wrinkles. More glowing and younger look skin! Recommend it! This is a thick and heavy cream but it does absorb pretty quickly after applying. It does leave my skin feeling oily for longer than I would prefer. I have tried other Estee lauder moisturizers and this is not one I would repurchase because it did not work for my personal preferences. After using this product I did not notice a difference in my skins appearance. I found the cream to be a bit thick and not very hydrating. There are better products on the market. Received this as a trial from Influenster for an honest review.  So glad to have had the opportunity to try it too!This moisturizer was very good. I typically have normal skin but as the weather changes it tends to get drier in the cooler months. I find that this definitely helps keep my skin from feeling dry. It absorbs very well, has a light scent, non-greasy yet makes skin supple and hydrated.  I liked it very much and I think at this price point it’s worth it! I really love the way this makes my skin feel. I think it’s too soon to see any visible results which is why I only gave 4 stars but it definitely feels like it’s doing something and I’m excited about it. I received this complimentary to test and love it. It doesn’t have an oily feel at all and makes my skin feel very moisturized. I am not huge into scents but this one is light. I received a small sample of this cream from Influenster to review. I think the sample was a bit small to test it’s anti aging properties. However, so far I really like how it is feeling on my skin. Works wells with my combo skin - enough moisture for the stubborn dry parts. But not too much or clogging my more oily parts. I plan on purchasing a regular size one to truly test the anti aging claims. I got this complimentary from influenster and i love it. Only receieved a small sample jar but it definitely makes me wana buy full size. My skin is dry n gets worse when fall and winter hit, this made my face feel soft and hydrated. Anything with hyaluronic acid in it sign me up You definitely can feel the luxury from the packaging to the feeling of the thick and moisturizing cream. Worked really well under makeup for me. Unfortunately with the trial size I received I don’t think I had enough time to see long term benefits, but it definitely feels nice and moisturizing. Love love love it!! Made my skin look so amazing!! Some one asked if I had Botox!! Get it now! I don’t have any wrinkles or fine lines, so I can’t speak to how it works for those, but it is a great moisturizer. It isn’t heavy or sticky. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, kind of a basic “skin care” scent. I love this product it made my face feel so good and it is definitely a plus to put on before makeup your makeup looks so much better on your face I have combination skin, mostly dry throughout the day, especially in the morning. I have to use a skin moisturizer. I don’t use it everyday, but sometimes my skin is in need of a miracle, even my eyelids feel dry. After using the moisturizer it left my face looking very refreshed. My face felt hydrated and it didn’t have that tightness feeling that comes with dry skin. I also was complemented that I looked younger after apply this product to my face. Amazing but expensive. Left mt skin feeling healthy the times I had the chance to test it. My skin looked healthy and young and my makeup jus amazing.. 100% Recommended if you have the opportunity to put your hands on I love this silky smooth cream for my morning routine. The SPF ensures I don't forget sunscreen each day. I've been using the old one with spf 15 quite well except occasionl eye irritation. Then I switched to this new spf 25. The first time I applied it, it went fine just a little bit oily. After several hours when I looked at myself in the mirror, there were dry white peesl over my face. I tried to wipe off with tissue and then they got messy with my hair which looked like dandruff on my hair. The same problem when I used clinique smart cream spf 30 even if I just applied toner on my face. I just want a moisturizer with spf........disappointed I loved the previous one with SPF 15. The new one with SPF 25 made my skin very dry and caused serious allergy reaction. I wish I can buy old one with SPF 15. Im used to estee lauder products but this was new for me. Ive been needing a moistrizing product especially in winter. This applied very nice on the skin, absorbed well. Was in no eay greasy. 10/10 gifted by Estée Lauder This is the third year that I have been in love with my moisturizer. It's a fantastic face moisturizer. I love everything about it: the smell, the texture, and the packaging. I'm a big fan of all Estee Lauder products; their quality speaks for itself. I strongly recommend starting to use it! I am fair and live in New England, so I need a really good day moisturizer with SPF. This is one I use all year long. It protects against incidental sun exposure, has a light, pleasant fragrance, and is thick enough to protect my skin in the winter. I also have rosacea, and this does not cause breakouts. I have been considering buying this product for some time. I love the regular Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer but wanted the added SPF. Before purchasing this product, I had been using the regular Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer as part of my skincare regimine for months without issue. After 4 days of using the Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer with SPF, my skin was so notably and visibly dry that I had to stop using the product. Now I'm stuck with over $100 worth of moisturizer that leaves my skin dryer than before I applied it. Extremely disappointing. Have been using Estee Lauder products for many years and have credit them for the fact that people think I'm 10 years younger than I really am!  I've been using Resilience face and neck creme but decided to try Revitalizing Supreme because it had 25 Sun protection factor.  I like it as well as Revitalizing and appreciate the extra sun protection. Thicker and more oily than the original formula. The added sunscreening component irritates my eyes frequently, will go back to the original Revitalizing Supreme Youth Power Creme. The product is very good, but it is not good that the bottles come with air gaps. It's not the first time, I've already received eye creams like this too. I think that's why I decided to complain. I attach photos Ok cream but I think there are better options out there that work much better AND save $. Loreal midnight cream and serum are way better. Nice and creamy for my dry skin I revere the holiday 2025 Blockbuster Cool Set with this product and I just the first months benefits make me a true believer. As my aging skin loses elasticity this makes my skin seem smoother. The gift set I bought with the Revitalizing Supreme+ has a strong chemical smell, similar to perm solution. I also haven't noticed any improvements when using it at night with the serum—in fact, it's making my skin feel even drier. I get much better results from using glycolic acid than from this product. I also saw a review on your website from someone who had the same experience. I'm very disappointed. Even the other items included in the set feel cheap, almost like they're poorly made I love this! so moisturizing and i can feel the difference after a week I have used, and even sold estee lauder cosmetics for years. This moisturiser is not the same, smell, texture, feel, that i've used for years. wouldn't recommend the one sold here sadly I have been using Estee Lauder products for a good 7 years and have bought this exact product from Esteelauder.com - this is the first time purchasing through Ulta Beautys app and the product is noticeably different.
the smell is different, the feel of the product on my skin and its absorbancy. The product from Ulta Beauty does not hydrate my skin enough and i have to apply multiple times. 

I forgot to add that I use Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair on damp skin (spritzed rose water) before applying moisturizer.

Will continue to buy direct from Estee Lauder This new one is not as thick as the original ""Cell"" version. But it is still hydrating and could be used in summer.
Will continue use it. I have been using Estee Lauder cleanse, toner, moisturizing cream, night serum, foundation, powder foundation, lipsticks, and mascara since 2022. They are all amazing!

I LOVE the Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer! See the photo :) I tried a deluxe sample of the Re-Nutritive Diamond moisturizer and LOVED it! Unfortunately it is out of my price range. I love Estée Lauder for makeup and perfumes, and wanted to find a moisturizer that I could incorporate into my routine that fit with my budget. I love the ingredients in this one and the benefits they supposedly give, but I think I got a bad batch? It smelled like the chemicals from a perm. The smell was so bad I couldn't keep using it. It also didn't feel as smooth and luxurious as the Re-Nutritive did. This is my favorite night cream, it's not greasy it smells clean and my face always feels amazing This is one of the best moisturizers i have ever tried.  It is in the top 3 of my go to for winter months and even summer when i'm using my retinols.  To be honest if it weren't for the price it would probably be my #1.  I always buy it when its on sale during a beauty event, but if I could I would stock it year round.  I really don't think you can go wrong with this regardless of the skin type you have.  My skin is dry in the winter and combo in the summer and this is still great for me year round.  Definitely can tell a difference when I'm not using it. Love this product.  My skin drinks it up.  Goes on smooth and feels great.  Have been using it for a few years after Prescriptives when out of business.  It doesn't clog my pores and works great under makeup.  BUT BEWARE of SHIPPING.  My last shipment was given to On Track instead of UPS and they delivered it to the wrong address.  It took over a week to resolve with Estee. On Track would not respond to my concerns but Estee Customer Service took care of it but this still took several days.  Still took another week to get my order.  May want to consider paying for quicker shipping just to make sure UPS is the shipper and it doesn't get handed off to On Track. But I'm afraid to try it and like it because they're too expensive to purchase regularly. This moisturizer is good, I do like the way the resilience moisturizer absorbs a little better on my mature skin. 
I am an Estée Lauder loyalty member. I love the way it smells not to heavy and melts right into my skin can't wait to see what results I get from this product. This is my go to moisturizer for daily use. I have aging skin and it leaves it so soft and moisturized but not greasy or oily looking. It's perfect under makeup! It's amazing. It works well. It's good for the skin. I always buy more of it. Can't live without it and you can use it with other skin care. I am a 65 year old African American male who swears by Estee Lauder products.  The Revitalizing Youth Power Creme has been a game changer for me.  I notice results after continuous use in a matter of 7 days.  I know that your products are primarily made for women but you really needs to push more men into using it.  I love it. It smells so terrible that I thought it had gone bad. I exchanged it for another with the same result. 
I don't know how well the product may or may not work because the scent is so horrible I could not continue putting on my face. Rancid I have sensitive skin that breaks out or gets irritated easily and this leaves my skin feeling like silk at night! I wake up looking more rejuvenated than when I don't use it! I'll admit that I don't have a solid skincare routine, but I always make sure to use this at night and can tell it's made a difference! It does what it says it will. Applies nicely & acts as a good primer too I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and ready for make up. It's my ""go to"" moisturizer!  I used to wear DayWear until things changed-my skin didn't like it anymore. But I have to say it made me switch to this Revitalizing line and I couldn't be happier with it. Been using it for years now. I'll keep using it as long as EL keeps making it! This has been a life saver. During pregnancy I have been using this and I can see great improvement with freshness and my skin is almost glowing. I used with serum and face wash which makes a huge difference too. Absolutely love it I purchased this product after receiving a small amount of it as a promotional free gift when I purchased my foundation.  I absolutely love this product and the Revitalizing Supreme Moisturizer for the eyes.  I can truly tell a difference in my skin.  I apply the DayWear moisturizer after application of the Revitalizing moisturizer and my face/neck feels like silk.  My foundation goes on perfectly afterwards.  All I can say is try it, I think you will love it. I like this moisturizer overall.   It's substantial and a rich cream that doesn't leave my face feeling greasy.   I do wish the scent wasn't quite so heavy.   I haven't used it long enough to know if it will decrease fine lines but I look forward to what it will do for my skin after a month or two of use. I'm so surprised by the quality of this product. Feels like cheap, thick silicone. I wasn't expecting this from a brand like Estée Lauder. If you try it, keep an eye on the return window so you don't get stuck with bad expensive moisturizer. This cream applies terribly and pills really badly Subtle fragrance and great for sensitive skin- I learn I can't wear the daywear or pink line but this is amazing- heavy like I want! This is a new product for me even thought I used the original one for three years. It works well for my combination skin and keeps it moisturizing. This moisturizer is hands down.The best one i've ever purchased and used. I feel like a little bit goes a long way, and I genuinely feel as though I see a difference in my skin immediately. I love it so much, I bought one for my mother well! After 1 month of use this is NOT for me. I have DRY mature skin so I am use to applying a thicker, richer formulation but this one just doesn't spread well. After 1 month no difference. I am disappointed because of the cost, have had better results with less expensive creams, of which I will go back too. Also I wish I could upload a picture I took of a big gap in the container, it's an air pocket therefore product is missing. I purchased two refillable pots of the revitalizing supreme online on April 7, 2025 (order confirmation #6262711308). The product does not have the same lovely fragrance as the store-bought one. In fact, it smells like a chemical. The product is also less creamy. I would like to know why this is the case. I am now questioning whether the product I received is an original Estee Lauder item. Additionally, I was shocked that one of the gifts was a small flat sachet and not a mini bottle. Love the creaminess of the moisturizer. I have purchased this before, and it does not feel greasy and makes your skin very soft. It keeps my skin supple and looking younger than my years. I think.  Love it! I'm a big fan of Estee Lauder and to purchase this cream for half price was a no brainer. Wish this would happen more of her products. Exceptional skin care products. I love everything about this moisturizer! It's Rick and soothing while supporting my skin barrier and correcting wrinkles and elasticity Very pleased with this product. My mom gave me this moisturizer to try and I fell in love with it. She worked for Estée Lauder in Toronto, Canada for over 24 years and always came home smelling the best! I've used Estée Lauder since I was 13 years old and am now 56!  It was under her advisement that I invest in my skin as we all need to protect our skin as much as possible! . It's definitely a product line I would trust my beauty regimen with. Needless to say I'm hooked with all the products I've purchased thus far. Quality and product is top notch and I appreciate the results. Just ordered the Bounce back moisturizer and so looking forward to trying it. The moisturizer is AMAZING! My skin is so soft and clear after just using it 5 days. I highly recommend Estee Lauder products! this cream made my skin so smooth and bouncy. I genuinely have seen this product make a difference with my skin - I can tell after 1-2x using. If I've missed using it for a week or something, I can tell after using it for one day that it smoothes my wrinkles and skin tone. I use it on my neck as well and feel like it helps to keep skin quality vs other products. I will use this as long as it's available!! I have been using this product for several years.  I am a redhead with sensitive skin and have only good things to say about it. 30- 40 Latina with acne. I stopped using since the dermatologist recommended Cerave 2 yrs ago. i went along with it to save money. But I am convinced like in all clinical trials, it is severely biased against indigenous skin tones and POC. somehow I keep coming back to Estee Lauder specifically for the night eye cream and this particular moisturizer. 
just 2 days and my face feels nourished, blemishes are gone, skin feels tight. It is great for my brown skin. 
It is true it is a little greasy, but how much are you all using? you really need to get used to using as little as possible as it goes a long way. I like to get the travel sizes because the moisturizer will stay fresh longer, plus somehow it comes out a few dollars less. 
Everyone from friends to partner to complete strangers have complimented my youthful look, except for the 2 years off this moisturizer. This stuff takes 10 years off at least from what I can tell. Give it a shot now! I was really disappointed in the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream Moisturizer. The perfume smell was so strong that I could not use it on my face. This day cream is very nourishing. My skin has become smooth after using it, and I really like it. I've been using it for years and will continue to do so in the future. This moisturizer works well for my 56 year old combination skin.  Happy with purchase. I've used Estée Lauder skincare all my life.  My favorite I'd Advanced Night Repair Serum.  My second favorite is this cream.  I'm 71 and have no wrinkles  - just some sagging.   This cream smells great and it's  special ingredients tightens the skin and makes it glow.  The texture is a marvelous gel cream and it glides onto the skin.  ULTA occasionally has it at 1/2 price! I really wanted to like this bc I LOVE Estee. But this did nothing for my skin. I even used the serum underneath. Clarins serum is what works I love the way it goes on and how it feels on my face. It softens my skin and helps with my dry skin. I have never used a more luxurious moisturizer. I got it as a sample and I had to run to buy the full size. It makes me look so youthful and my fine lines are GONE! I notice a massive difference in my appearance when I use this(only at night). I also use the advanced night repair serum which pairs well together. I have very sensitive combo skin. I'm super dry during the winter and oily diring the summer. Adding this to my skincare routine has completely transformed my skin. BUY IT! You will not regret it at all. It's honestly better than my Kiehl's moisturizer and I've been using that one for years. I was using lancome but cannot afford it anymore so I bought this, I love it, my skin looks better! I was using lancome but cannot afford it anymore so I bought this, I love it, my skin looks better! Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ is always in my makeup bag!! I am in my 40's with combination skin and I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I use it every morning. Absorbs quickly, doesn't pile and leaves my face moisturized without being greasy or clogging pores. Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ is always in my makeup bag!! I am in my 40's with combination skin and I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I use it every morning. Absorbs quickly, doesn't pile and leaves my face moisturized without being greasy or clogging pores. I've been using this for three days and while it hasn't caused any harm to my face it feels greasy and the smell is really strong. the smell seems unnecessary. it really bothers me at night and makes my eyes burn and continue to burn the next day. I don't think I will be able to continue using it. it goes on smooth and feels good, but the smell is so strong it gave me a headache. i don't like fragrance on my face. if they made a fragrance free version, I'd try that! This is so creamy and moisturizing, not greasy at all! I noticed a difference within the first week my skin was more even toned and so soft!!! I was gifted by Estée Lauder for my honest opinion. I am very pleased with how well it works. It's so soft and creamy. I've found myself using it day and night. Estée Lauder makes such great products. I love this supreme moisture I have struggled with stubborn acne in my mid-late 30's very badly, I think it's hormonal. I actually was about to fill my first prescription for Accutane which was my last resort and I was hesitant to use. I used this moisturizer with the entire ANR linefor 1 month (I am saving up to try the Cleansing Balm)and I noticed a big different with my skin clearing. 3 months later I have not had 1 pimple and my acne scares have lightened considerably, my friends have been commenting on my face, that my acne is gone and my skin looks so smooth. I was able to cancel my doctor's appointment and never picked up my prescription. This SAVED my skin. I know this product isn't designed to treat acne but it sure does!! I was gifted by Estée Lauder their Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright Radiance Power Soft Crème and it feels like absolute butter on my skin! It has a thicker texture that feels luxurious on. I light to put it on as the last step in my skincare routine because I always know I'll wake up with glowing, bright skin! This revitalizing supreme plus bright radiance power soft cream was gifted to me by ester lauder. This cream full of vitamin c, with radical radiance. This cream helps with brown patches, dullness, gives firmness. I ran out of this moisturizer last year and decided to try something else. I regretted that decision every morning. Glad to be back! My Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright Radiance Power Soft Creme has definitely improved the appearance of my skin. It's powerful vitamin c and other ingredients has helped make my skin look brighter and tighter. Gifted by EstéeLauder. Gifted by esteelauder. I've been using the Estée Lauder Supreme Bright Moisturizer for a few weeks, and I'm genuinely impressed. The texture is luxuriously lightweight yet deeply hydrating, making it perfect for both day and night use. It absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue, which is a huge plus for my combination skin. One of the standout features is its brightening effect. My skin looks noticeably more radiant and even-toned, with a subtle glow that feels natural, not overdone. The formula also feels gentle, even on sensitive days, and layers beautifully under makeup. Gifted by Estée Lauder, and after using it for almost two weeks, I have to say that the results are surprisingly amazing. I know it usually takes consistency and time to see results in skincare, but I began noticing a difference in my skin from the first week. My skin appears brighter, and it feels soft and hydrated. I also feel that some of my dark spots have lightened. Normally, I'm not one to splurge on high-end products, but I will definitely be purchasing a full-sized version of this cream. I wouldn't consider myself to have sensitive skin as I've tried many different skin care products and I've never had a reaction like this. My skin developed clusters of itchy red bumps within a few hours of applying…… I love the Estée Lauder serum though and after applying it I just use my go-to moisturizer. Avoid this product at all costs! Gifted by Estée Lauder. I think this cream was super hydrating and nice to use. It made my skin feel great and I will be purchasing the bigger size after using the small one. I really like it. I recommend! Very hydrating, im acne prone and this did not break me out. I love this cream. This moisturizer is fabulous. It leaves my skin soft and glowing. I LOVE the luxurious feel and softness to touch. I apply with my nighttime routine daily and could not be more pleased. I would recommend this to anyone. This moisturizer was a gifted by esteelauder and was the perfect addition to my routine! It is a hydrating moisturizer that is not very thick. It doesn't leave you feeling greasy and it plays well with other skincare products. My skin feels deeply hydrated and has this subtle, radiant glow. It's lightweight yet super nourishing—perfect for my daily routine. Highly recommend it if you're looking to brighten up your complexion. Gifted by Estée Lauder Great moisturizer, I love it. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright Power Soft Creme for a month, and it's a game-changer for my skincare routine! The texture is lightweight yet hydrating, perfect for my combination skin. The Vitamin C has noticeably brightened my complexion, leaving my skin looking more even-toned and radiant. It absorbs quickly and layers well under makeup. Definitely worth the investment for anyone seeking a glowy, hydrated finish! Gifted by esteelauder I was super excited to try out this Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + Bright Radiance Power Soft Creme. The deluxe size is actually very generous because a little product goes a long way. I applied this creme after washing my face and the product seeped right into my skin. The creme is a light texture but it feels luxurious on your skin. I've been using this for over a week and I must say my skin looks much healthier. It gives you much needed hydration but it also gives you this soft air brushed glow. It really is a wonderful moisturizer! I highly recommend as it works well on all skin concerns ans types. I was gratefully gifted this product complimentary from Estee Lauder and Skeepers in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin which is a little much work to deal with when my skin is both dehydrated dry and very oily , and this is beautiful and helps moisture my skin without being too oily and helps with my discoloration Complimentary from Estée Lauder I received this sample for free in exchange for my honest opinion.
It's very airy and creamy and smells so good. Doesn't leave your skin feeling oily or greasy.
Leaves a slight glow once you put it on. It's great and I will buy more! Gifted by Estée Lauder. Supreme Bright Moisturizer is a must-have! First, the scent is absolutely delightful. I love its creamy, thick texture that glides effortlessly onto my skin. The cooling effect is incredibly refreshing, making it a joy to apply. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling deeply hydrated and nourished. The best part? It provides long-lasting hydration while adding a radiant glow to my skin.

Ive been needing a moistrizing product especially in winter. This applied very nice on the skin, absorbed well. Was in no eay greasy. 10/10 The best moisturizing cream! 
 It gives my skin gorgeous glow. 
 Simply the best for a well moisturized skin and the base for a good overall healthy looking skin
 A must have for your daily routine
 I couldn't recommend it enough!
Complimentary from esteelauder I absolutely love this cream. You do not need a lot and it works very well. I definitely have noticed results and my skin feels stronger and more hydrated. I was gifted by Estée Lauder to give you my experience. Is your skin lacking brightness and hydration. Does Winter have your skin exhausted and dull. This cream helped instantly enhanced the overall glow of my skin. Just use a small amount each day after using a serum. It moisturized easily into my skin like butter. I can highly.recommend this cream.
As with all other Estee products, this o e is also superior. Wonderful moisturizer but light and not oily. Smoothes and freshens the skin. I received a sample and while it feels nice and makes my skin feel soft and hydrated I can't stand the smell. It's a very strong perfume smell. It also clashes with my perfumes when I want to wear them. I'll continue using the daywear line. I received this complimentary from esteeLauder and from a honest review I can visibly see a difference in my wrinkles and lungs that was not as pronounced as normal all not to mention the fact that my face looked much more hydrated and it was shining bright I was lucky to receive the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright Radiance Power Soft Crème as a gift from the brand, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations. The texture is incredibly luxurious light yet hydrating and it melts beautifully into the skin without feeling greasy. Gifted by Estée Lauder. I love this, it makes my skin look and feel so good! This was gifted to me by estee lauder thank you! I've only recently gotten into Estée Lauder skincare and I've been pleasantly surprised! I love this cream already, I've been using it every night and I already notice such a difference under my eyes. I received this sample in exchange of my honest opinion. I have to be honest this it's so small so thin to see if really works , i don't see any changes on my skin , I add this on my skincare routine and have delicious aroma but it's so small . This sample was gifted by esteelauder. My mom bought this moisturizer for me, and I continued buying it for myself. It is so luxurious. It makes my skin feel like great! I use it morning and night, and my skin loves it. I've tried other brands, but I always come back. It seems like a splurge, but it lasts so long that it's totally worth it! very  good！I like it！ Works well, but scent is strong so use sparingly. I am a loyal customer of Estée Lauder products. Here are my feelings about using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Global Anti-Aging Cell Power Creme.
 
This moisturizing cream has a wonderful texture. It is rich but not overly greasy. When applied to the face, it spreads smoothly and is quickly absorbed, providing an instant sense of hydration and comfort. After using it for a period of time, I can clearly notice that my skin has become more supple and elastic. The dryness and dullness that used to bother me have been significantly reduced. It seems to have a remarkable effect on improving the overall condition of my skin, making it look healthier and more radiant. It has truly become an essential part of my daily skincare routine, and I highly recommend it to those who are seeking effective moisturizing and anti-aging solutions. My skin feels firmer, stronger, and lifted. I am 53 years old and cream helps me look younger, and erases wrinkles. I really love it!!! I have tried many moisturizers that make me feel greasy, I break out all the time. I'm new to Estee lauder products by 2 weeks. I dont have of experience like some but I'm 51 and will NEVER use anything else. After 2 weeks I see my skin looking so good, my husband said "" your skin looks different "" you look like you are glowing and under your eyes, you have no darkness"", He's so cute. I started using it on him, stay tunes. I used it on my prom night and it made me confident and have a great night, very much recommend I love all Estée Lauder products especially the Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer. Works really well to erase any wrinkles. in love with this moisturizer. my skin is glowing This cream is amazing which will conceal eye wrinkles even in direct sunlight.
Lauder sent me a full size sample.  I like it so much, I purchased the full size

Fenty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation,"best foundation in the market, love it!! best for oily skin this was my first foundation that i’ve ever had, and after using it for a long time (i went through a period of base makeup blindness 💀), it was just okay, from what i remember. even though it is a matte foundation, i remember it drying down very cakey, it’s high-coverage so you don’t need a lot, but then again, even with a normal amount i found it to be very cakey. it’s not very layerable, and after a while it defines your forehead lines and other wrinkle lines. it starts to pill around oily areas, especially around my t-zone where my glasses are as well. it also oxidizes A LOT, and it just made me look orange once it fully settled into my skin, despite me getting shade matched. This oxidizes so orange! When I first applied it, it looked like a great match. After about 20 minutes it looked so orange and defined every fine line on my face. Returned. I bought the wrong color so that’s my fault! However this foundation is beautiful! Love how it blurs and stays matte during the day on my oily skin! I have mixed experiences with this. One day it’s fine, the next it’s not. Same routine everytime. I am fair skinned and when testing at the store it was right. I used it on my face and it might as well have been unrubbed in sunscreen. For the price I am so disappointed separates and cakey. worst foundation ever i wanted to like it so bad because its fenty but it doesnt live up to any of her other products Best foundation which i ever tried best of all foundations Good coverage but left my skin very dry despite having combo skin. It made my makeup look cakey. Did not break me out tho and it lasted the whole day. love it, one bottle lasts me 1-3 months ! it’s full coverage and covers up my bad acne I used to love this foundation so much. I bought it immediately on launch and it was the only product that lasted on my oily skin throughout the day and had beautiful coverage but the last 2 bottles I bought I notice become very shiny and greasy after a short period of time and have less coverage. I’m disappointed because I loved this foundation so much and went through many bottles of it. If you are very oily I wouldn’t recommend it but if you are mildly or combo this would still probably be a good option. I have oily acne prone skin and have been using this foundations for years. This became my favourite foundation pretty quickly after trying and remained my top choice until my latest bottle. This foundation used to be much more mattifying and lasting 8-10+ hours, but with my latest bottle it no longer holds up nearly as well. I would call this a natural finish. The old formula did not require a powder in the deep winter, and this one absolutely does, and that's unheard of for me. This new formula requires powder basically always. I will be finishing what I have and will not repurchase as I want something more mattifying. Tried it for a few weeks and it was just too cakey/separated on my skin despite trying no primer, different primers, etc. Loved the scent of this foundation however I found that the formula was thin and had to add multiple layers to achieve full coverage.  It was hard to find a shade match.  Good foundation for the price and would be great for someone who doesn’t have many dark spots or blemishes to cover. I've recently switched to this foundation after 25+ years of wearing another brand. It's great coverage, matte finish and the shade match is dang near perfect. I bought two bottles at one time because I loved it so much. I’ve repurchased this foundation several times, but recently noticed a change in the formula. While it’s marketed as suitable for oily skin, it no longer performs as expected on my combination skin. Even with proper skincare prep and setting powder, it leaves me looking oily throughout the day. It feels heavy on the skin, settles into my laugh lines, and transfers quite easily. Unfortunately, it now feels more like a product sitting on top of my skin rather than blending in naturally. Super spotty/splotchy. I even made sure to use a water base primer before. This is the perfect full coverage foundation. I need a foundation for a special occasion and this one worked out really well. It’s easy to use and blend. It does oxidize HOWEVER if you get the right shade that doesn’t become an issue. Undertones really matter wjth this one so be mindful of that when purchasing. This stuff riiight here-I friggin LOVE IT!!! I have been loyal to Estée Lauder foundation-was used at patents, catwalks, home, etc. This is MY generations foundation prototype. No other brand has come up with the PERFECT shade of foundation. FENTY gets fair black skin (even if you tan naturally from the sun, like me, there is a shade for you). I am so happy Isabella found my perfect shade. I truly can’t thank her enough. Ugly, cakey, flakey, drying, heavy, separates and transfers, sticky feeling, emphasizes skin texture and flaws. Hate it hate it hate it. Not worth a penny. Straight to the trash. I just love me some Fenty Beauty always used liquid and powder makeup My skin color is a bit uneven so it’s hard to know my color but with this foundation it made me look one color and didn’t look off putting I’d say this product does a great job of covering up underlying acne scars and blemishes but the consistency was a little too thick and clogging for my skin. It’s good as a longwear, heavy foundation but wouldn’t really be my go to for everyday wear Great makeup for mature skin . I am 51 years old Fenty for the win get you some . I love this brand . Makes me feel and look pretty Too orange ! Like all the shades oxidize so much it’s crazy Dries quickly, gets difficult to blend. Over all a nice finish is blended properly on a good base seriously so good for all skin types I would say and the worth the money . love all the shade ranges too and it's buildable Best foundation i’ve ever used it blends right in ! I love how this foundation gives a natural glow without looking greasy. It feels super lightweight, lasts all day, and provides great coverage without feeling heavy. Perfect for everyday wear—definitely buying again! I’ve been using this product for the past several months and it is by far my favorite foundation I’ve ever used. It is a buildable foundation, and it always makes my skin look so amazing. I am especially happy with the range of shades, as I am very pale and often times brands don’t have a light enough shade for me. The oxidation is great and sets to my skin tone perfectly i think ill go for the next shade down for the summer I absolutely love the Fenty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Foundation! The coverage is flawless, the finish is smooth and natural, and it truly lasts all day without feeling heavy. It blends beautifully and gives my skin that soft, airbrushed look. Hands down, one of the best foundations I’ve ever used—Rihanna really did her thing with this one! I love THIS FOUNDATION SO MUCH its one of the best foundations you’ll ever use I have oily and dry combination skin so this literally works if you either skin, so amazing and it’s honestly so good 10/10 and the  price is so good too like 40$ worth it!!!! Not super full coverage. It lays on nicely, but the coverage isn’t there. It’s better for those who may not have scaring or acne i gave a 2 star because I like how the product feels on my skin, BUT........It claims it mattifies but I still look like a greasy chicken wing. Tried the Fenty Beauty foundation today — and yes, the hype is REAL 💁🏽‍♀️🔥 This shade was too light for me but it feels very nice on the skin. The coverage is very nice. I believe it’s medium coverage but it covers all my dark spots and blemishes pretty well. Doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry. I like it, wish I had it in my shade THE BEST!!! Use a brush to apply this.. i made the mistake of trying a blender and it became super blotchy throughout the day. The brush gave a super filtered finish that lasted with the right setter ;) this was my love at first shade match LOL i've tried different foundations/skin tints but i just keep coming back to this. so lightweight, don't care if i use it everyday for summer cause it's actually NON-COMEDOGENIC?? I'M SOLD! Gives very nice beautiful coverage, it looks so nice in person and on camera and doesn’t feel heavy at ALL I never write reviews but I have to say- this foundation is like a miracle if your biggest concern is oily skin like me. I live in hot humid Florida and my makeup used to melt off. This doesn’t. Buy it if primers used to laugh at you. So natural, First time I purchased it in 2021 and still buy this. I would love to try more products from #Fentybeauty. The hype this product is definitely worth a purchase, because the way this went on to my skin like butter and spread into my skin tone like it was my actual face?! I was shocked. A little goes a far way, and as I said, it spreads well. Just ensure you get a shade test so you buy the right color, and you are good to go!!! I love this foundation so much! It is super easy to apply and blend into my skin, usually other foundations can feel cakey and too heavy on my face, but this Fenty!! So good and soft! I use shade 300 and pair it with the hourglasses concealer “Dune” I like the way it feels and the bottle/pump but this foundation sometimes looks very cakey and patchy and I end up just removing it and using a different one bc there’s no way I can walk out of the house like that 🥲 I think I’ll go back to my regular cheaper target foundation i hate it, it’s so hard to blend and irritate my skin so bad! the coverage it’s the only thing good about this product I forgot to write important information in my last review. First this foundation goes on light it darkens on. Second you need to find the perfect amount for you. You only need a little. Also when I forget to shake the bottle that also makes a difference. Pros: Didn’t settle in to fine lines or pores, not cakey on my already very dry skin
Cons: Oxidized from a perfect-shade-match neutral peach color to a warm orange in 3 hours. That being said I know foundations incisive more or less on different people I'm so glad to have found the perfect foundation! It has great coverage that isn't too thick or heavy, and enough tones for anyone to find their perfect match. I am not a heavy makeup user, so appreciate that this gives me a natural look. The price is good for the amount of product you get, and the brand is cruelty free which is very important to me. I love this foundation and as long as they keep selling I am a life long customer! I've been using this foundation for years now and it is the perfect coverage. just got ready to reorder yet again and now it's showing as no longer available.
hopefully I can find something comfortable through Sephora Good product but it oxidizes a lot it was way darker after 6 hours then when i put it om Probably one of the absolute worst foundations I've ever used. I did follow the directions about shaking it. Tried it with multiple primers tried multiple application methods and still it sat on top of my pores sunk into my fine lines. This actually isn’t a cool foundation-Sephora describes it as such but Fenty’s website says it’s warm with golden undertones-which it is and it’s my perfect shade. Wears very well and lightweight for the amount of coverage. I absolutely loved this foundation. I hope to God their not discontinuing it. One of my best purchases as a foundation. I really love every Fenty product but this one deserves special place in your makeup collection I learned love this foundation. I have realized you need only a little, too much and it's no good. I started using it with the matching powder foundation, just to realize they are absolutely flawless together, right when they discontinued the powder. So I am hoping she relaunches some sort of matching powder again. It's such a perfect fit for my dark skin. It looks pale at first. After blending it, it fit perfectly with my skin tone. One of the best foundations I have tried yet! Love the wear. Really is skin like and gives an amazing glow. It does have a bit of fragrance but not irritating in any way. The best coverage and doesn’t crack/separate. I was unsure if this would match but it did perfectly and it’s a build up foundation This foundation is better then Lancôme, Haus labs, and all the nars, Armani, Patrick ta, I have tried them all and this one will forever be the one I buy over and over again it’s the best out there i promise I use this product daily to cover my rosacea. It provides full coverage without looking like I applied clay to my face. It stays all day! I just threw this product in the trash. It is terribly patchy in oxidizes and turns your face orange. I just threw this product in the trash. It is awful. It comes out patchy every time I apply it. I turned completely orange when it oxidizes. been buying this foundation for years but with this last purchase the formula seems different which is greatly noticeable on my skin in a bad way! /: This shade is the perfect match for me. It doesn’t crease like other foundations do and provides excellent coverage. I’m in love with its longevity as well. Be very mindful of skin prep before application. Chalky and cakey finish. I used this trying to find a silicone based foundation, I'm pretty pale with peachy/cool undertones and thought this looked beautiful in store! I went home and tried it myself and realized it smells really weird (not good for my sensitive skin). I tried it anyways with my typical makeup routine and found out it oxidizes very badly!! It made me turn orange! I wouldn't buy again unless the formula changes. The finish is very nice. I'm usually more of a luminous, glowy girl, but this is matte without being dry. The coverage is medium, it really gives your skin but better, which is totally my vibe however, my skin just doesn't like the formula. I began to break out after the first time wearing it, While out i felt my skin becoming very oily and later that day bumps, which i haven't had in years due to a round of ISoTretinoin. Favorite foundation so far, upgraded from Fit Me to Fenty so far it has been a good foundation love the natural finish This is VERY Matte if you're not oily I wouldn't recommend this. I'm combo but found this looking super drying on my skin because it's just not a compatible formula for me. I do think the foundation is  beautiful and I love the coverage and vanilla scent. Best foundation yet I’ve been using this since when it costed 32$. Still the best foundation I’ve ever used. It’s a solid product, it does what it’s supposed to do. Color range of course is another plus I love love love this product! Lays beautifully with a nice soft matte finish. However, I find that sometimes I need to be mindful of the skin prep I use and how much, for example, a staple in my  is the Good Molecules and Ordinary Hyaluronic acid serums. Sometimes I find that it will pill off of my face. Another note about this foundation is how quickly it dries. I find you have to blend fairly quickly or it will not budge. All in all though, a beautiful foundation !routine I love this product! This helped with my oily skin and lasted throughout the whole day! This product dries like a powder, so it is very important that you are well moisturized beforehand, or else it is difficult to apply I did not receive my package and sephora does not want to refund or reship due to their ""policies"". Super light weight and a great match with my skin tone! Would totally reccommend! It's a plus if you use a primer from the same brand! Works great!! So I still have this foundation my only issue with it and as to why I change to a different one was because everytime I would apply it it would not stay on my face and it would separate from my skin making it so much difficult to apply Even with correct skin prep this foundation separates rather right away or within an hour. It is extremely difficult to blend, as you must blend it immediately or it will literally stay in the exact place. I do not recommend. I love this stuff it's great! I don't wear makeup often just date night or a special event but, when i do it gives simple, soft, light, not to much i forget i have anything on. Its oos quite a bit but, I'm not mad i see why its bomb. It just compliments my skin in all the right ways. not sure if my shade match is off but no matter what I use under, it wants to settle in my pores which makes them appear more, looks cakey, separates with setting sprays and even after using fenty banana powder. I am oily but somehow still makes my skin look dry. Been using this for years. My go to - stays on all day and doesn’t irritate my skin. Great coverage. Orangey foundation. Oxidizes in seconds. Makes you look like an Oompa Loompa!!! Super disappointing! Makes my skin look flawlessand very lightweight.. love it! I used this product over the past few months, I am very satisfied with the matte results! Personally I like to apply moisturizer as I have normal skin type for feeling more hydrated. The coverage is pretty good and long-lasting. I recommend this productt specially for oily skin type. I don’t really wear foundation but I did buy this one to just have one.  I love the way it doesn’t cake up under my eyes! I tried twice. The first I tried I felt it too thick like too heavy. My face was kind of cracked and the second time I said maybe It’s too heavy for the day so I had to go out at night and I gave it a try one more time and it was too yellow🤣 so I couldn’t get this to work for my skin. I am dry but exfoliate and prep well. It broke up and clings to my dry skin. Would not recommend. I am a huge fan of Nars soft matte, it’s long been my holy grail and I love full coverage foundations. I got this during a sale and wasn’t expecting to really love it even though it’s a community favourite but I like it just as much as the Nars. It is full coverage but blends beautifully, it layers well and works with every product I’ve put over or under it. Once it’s set with powder it’s extremely resilient to any conditions. It’s got more of a skin like finish than the Nars I’d say and requires less of a skin prep regimen if you have dry skin. The shade range is excellent, too. I had to wear this foundation a few times before I decided I really love it, but it’s become one of my most reached for foundations. Fenty did a great job! Nars looks better in photos and on camera but in real life I’d say this foundation is the best for a fuller coverage look! I’m pretty oily and have been needing a matte foundation. I’m disappointed this one didn’t work because it was a perfect match when I first applied it. Once it dried down it was a bit darker and looked orange. On top of that, it dries so quickly that it can’t be blended with any cream products and accentuates any fine lines or blemishes. It’s the worst foundation I’ve ever used. It’s so blend. It’s so thick and gross. I wasted my money honestly. I've always loved this foundation. But I take a star off because the fragrance. Don't need a fragrance. Just take it out and it will be 5 star worthy. This foundation is so good for oily skin and almost fully covers my rosacea Ever since Fenty pulled up into the makeup scene, I’ve been a fan. I have sensitive/combo skin and this makeup lasts all day and does not smudge unless it’s makeup remover. Love the matte finish and is very great and build up of the contour and concealer of different brands. Best foundation I’ve ever used!!! Tried so many brands but they never blended right with my skin. Saw this on tik tok and thought why not try it and so glad I did. Very light coverage when applied correctly but still covers face well. (I struggle with dry skin but this foundation doesn’t show that) Will use this for my new daily makeup! The finish is sooooo beautiful and the coverage is great. It also doesn’t make my extremely sensitive, acne prone skin to break out which is great. Best foundation I’ve found so far and the pricing is not bad, my sister forgot her foundation and I let her borrow some and she loved it and is going to buy one. Really wanted to like this product but unfortunately it doesn’t really blend into my skin well, no matter what primers I use beforehand :( Dog poo, I looked great for the first hour then just melted off my face, ive tried multiple different applying techniques and it still looked cakey and crusty I was sadly kind of underwhelmed by this. It goes on shockingly light but when it oxidizes it dries down to nearly a perfect match for my skin, but it's orange-y, which is typical for me. My undertone is very pink, and even now that many lines are carrying foundations in my shade range it's still really difficult to find something that isn't neutral/warm leaning. Since I bought this ages ago I also started using adapalene and I don't think there's any way I could use this without drying the heck out of my already-dry face. I think the formula is great if it works for your skin, and you test out the shade beforehand in-store, but if you are looking for a very light foundation with a genuinely cool undertone this isn't it. I love that thy have color for my skin .. I hardly get my face color . I will buy again The packaging was cute and the foundation didn’t have any scent to it which is good. The blend-ability is not the Best But I think it will be good for people who likes a natural glow look. The coverage was great like it kind of covered my redness and pimple skin. I love this so much it's absolutely so good I have ALWAYS loved Ulta Store, however; I was extremely disappointed with my purchase. My bottle appeared to be full, but I have not been able to dispense the foundation. I'm planning to return my purchase for a new bottle. Perhaps the pump is broken, I'm not sure. This is the first time I was not totally satisfied. I'm about as experienced a foundation expert as there is! I'm a senior and have worn almost every brand known to the beauty world. At present I probably have ten different foundations. This Fenty product is amazing. The coverage is great without being too masky or dry looking. The color match I bought looks like my real skin! Bravo, Fenty. Love this product, not this review process Lightweight and not patchy if used right. I have been wearing makeuo since 7th grade so that means I have looked and used different foundations for almost 10 years (I'm 23 now). I used so many different brands from drugstore, high-end, and even Korean brands. This is the r one that had gotten me so MANY compliments! I have oily skin and the finish of this foundation is so great! Its like your skin but better. It seems to be like a powdery finish but still hydrating but doesn't make me oily. I'm a flight attendant so you best know a lot of external factors comes in to play but at the end of the day I still look good! You won't regret this foundation especialky if you have oily skin :) I was very happy with the coverage with just a little bit of product. I may be going back to this again and again Good I really wanted this to be as good as the claims, but this foundation is the worst i've ever used. It made my skin look extremely dry, it breaks up and looks granulated on skin, with a ton of skin prep btw. I want to know who is actually making this work? I've been wanting to try this and waited for it to go on sale. Unfortunately, just wasn't a good fit for me. I've tried different primers and moisturizer underneath and nothing makes it sit nicely on my skin without looking like I'm wearing a ton of foundation or that it's separating. Probably won't take the time to return because Ulta's not conveniently located near me. I think I have found my new go to. It looks and feels great. I could not pass this foundation up when I saw it on sale at Ulta. It goes on smooth with whatever you use. My first time wearing was at a baby shower and it held up perfectly. My face was not greasy looking after hours of wear with no touch ups. I'm so glad I bought this. I haven't used this foundation in years, but I picked up a bottle during the 21 Days of Beauty sale. I'm happy to report that it was even better than I remembered, and wore beautifully in this week's heat wave. I wish I'd picked up an extra bottle during the sale! I love this product best foundation ever 😍 I have oily skin type and in need of a long wear foundation that will last through south Florida heat and humidity. This was it for me I'll for ever be purchasing this foundation, it stays on 10hrs plus and feels so much lighter then others Ive tried. It can be medium or full coverage also which I love! I like full cobertura **not paid for this review***
Love this foundation! Doesn't transfer, concealer is not really needed due to the strong coverage quality. I highly recommend this for my brown girls due to the large shade collection and amazing quality Great deal on purchasing at the time It was a great match, however the product was very drying on my skin. Had to return it This product was a great choice and the value was great, the longevity and the blend is a great benefit, it's wonderful for my skin tone, No irritation, not oily, and I really don't need a powder finish unless I want to enhance the smoothness. I was discouraged when the color match recommendation option on here gave me three VERY different colors based off of the other foundations I use, then when I trued all three and none matched me. But I kept testing until I found the right color and OMG I'm SO glad I did. This is the prettiest foundation I have ever tried, and have tried a lot of them. It went on so smooth, gave an absolutely beautiful finish, and the coverage was nice with just one coat but was buildable to give a more full effect. And it LASTED! I wore it outside in pouring rain for 8+ hours working a renaissance faire and it didn't budge! I can't tell you how obsessed I am with it, honestly. I got it during 21 Days of Beauty at half off but will 100% pay full price in the future (and stock up any time I see it on sale again!). I used to have the wrong color but #390 fits me perfectly! Had to go into the store to get it rjust right though. Will purchase again and again love it I like the application of the foundation, and it didnt settle into my skin. I'm 47 and finding a foundation that works for my age, covers melasma and doesn't look bad is hard these day even though i have nice skin (other than hormone induced melasma). I do think the Ulta online color match system is not right. I looked like Morticia Addams in this (shade 120) when I color matched to my Armani Luminous Silk shade (4.75). Coincidentally, when I color shade matched on another makeup store website, it has it matching to shade 160. I guess I'm going to have a makeup artist shade match in person. I have PCOS and I have to shave my face everyday due to excess hair growth and this helps cover up everything from having to shave. It helps me not be embarrassed and hate myself. Thank you fenty for helping with my confidence 🫶🏻 I have been using this foundation for YEARS! Love the way it feels on my skin and the way it looks. Can use a small amount for a sheer complexion or a little more for fuller coverage. The foundation shade matched me perfectly. I returned another brand to go back to my Fenty brand. Hands down nothing else compares to the featherlight feel of this foundation. And it matches my skin tone perfectly. Applies good and doesn't make my face oily I have struggled with a super oily t-zone my whole life.  This is the first liquid foundation I have ever used that is not heavy feeling, provides a nice finish, and truly keeps my skin looking fresh and non-greasy all day.  I can't recommend this product enough for those with oily skin. The best match, to the point people often think I don't have on makeup in a good way. The best. The most helpful reviews are the Rihanna brand it self Looked horrible and cakey on my skin, dried up as soon as it went on. Do not recommend. So drying it settles into my skin so poorly . I don't have dry skin but this always makes my skin look so dry. I've tried it several times, years ago and i repurchased again recently to give it another shot, I wanted to like it so bad but it is the worst foundation I have ever tried Hands down the best foundation I've ever purchased. Stayed on all day long and didn't crease where the tarte face tape would crease such as the sides of my nose, under eyes and on my chin. Couldn't recommend enough! I have oily and sensitive skin and let me tell ya… my makeup looked just as good at night as it did in the AM and no breakouts from it. Ive never been more impressed with a foundation in my life. Dont walk, RUN and grab this foundation! The shade range is amazing as well. Cant say enough good things about this product. I was excited to try this but man... These reviews must be rigged. It's really watery and settled into every pore and dry spot. Yes I used primer. I am really loving the Fenty brand. This foundation covers everything without feeling heavy. And my skin looks and feels so much better. I have tried several Fenty products now and they are wonderful. They do exactly what they say they do. I would recommend to anyone. Love the product.  Perfect for my complexion. I bought this one 3 times Second purchase of this item because it worked the first time. Now it's literally slipping off my face. I live in Southern Indiana and it's humid here but I can't figure out how to make this work. My hair is actually sticking to my face by the end of the day. I do not have oily skin. Help :( Good consistency, buildable, lightweight I've been looking for something like tinted moisturizer that is light but has coverage and I stumbled on this and got the mini to try it out. Definitely use a damp beauty blender and do your face in sections because it is watery and dries pretty quick. Does seem to be build able but I havent tested that out much. It also kept me from looking oily. I work in surgery and wearing a mask, it didn't come off on my mask nearly as much as other foundations do. This was my first time using this product and I love it. The coverage is amazing and the it matches my skin tone perfectly. A little goes a long way. Base is to watery and not blendable. Daniel was awesome! I couldn't remember the foundation number for Fenty makeup. He was awesome and patient with all my questions! I love how flawless it makes my skin look!! Very nice formula! You have to really try and get the correct shade match because I was originally matched with 310 and that was too light. Then I tried the 315, and the 320, both did not look bad, but there was something off about the colors. I tried mixing the 310 with the 315 before the 320 came out and it was just an okay color on me. I didn't  love it, and then finally I watched someone on YouTube with my skin complexion using 335 and this was the perfect match! I did try the 330 and it was too warm on my skin. Now I look fabulous and it is good for the summer also does not transfer as I work with lot of paperwork. Fenty loose powder is Lovely too! I have severe melasma that I try covering up.This is a great full coverage. This product doesn't budge in the humid months. However, the packaging isn't great. After the 5th or so use, it always leaks. Wish they made a travel friendly bottle. I was really skeptical about orsering the product online because in the picture the color i was matched with from the camera option looked super dark. I did valid slreasearch about the color and placed the order. It arrived very quickly packaged to a T and arrived very quickly. It isnt anywhere near as dark as it looked in the online photos and surprisingly matched my skin tone pretty well. Overall great experience and once i try the makeup out on my face and see how it is this could potentially be a repurchase:)!! My only say is be careful the shade you order online because if you are looking for darker the pictures on ulta arent acurate . Thats all My holy grail foundation is the Charlotte Tilbury Flawless foundation but it was sold out everywhere so i did some research and decided to buy this foundation. Im absolutely in love with it and so glad I purchased it, it feels like im not wearing any foundation It's really light weight and does have buildable coverage. It dries fast so you have to spread it on your skin quickly but it doesn't feel like I even have makeup and the color match was pretty on point As someone who struggles with foundation from being too oily . This works amazinf and i look airbrushed . But if you are on the dryer side then this wouldnt work very well I absolutely love this foundation. It is amazing. I am not into makeup because I hardly ever wear make up, but I have an event and when I do use the make up this product is great. I don't put too much effort in it. It just goes on good. It looks great. I just love it. I received so many compliments about my makeup. I am truly thankful to the young lady who helped me find my correct match. This product is a must have in my makeup kit. It is very buildable coverage. I use for special events, or when I know I'm going to be photographed because it photographs so well. It is considered matte but is not drying at all. I have combination skin and use water based products, and this jives so well with my other products. I can't recommend this enough - a little goes a long way so it's definitely worth the price! Love Wrong shade bring back I switched from another premium brand that I used for years but discovered contained a lot of things I did not want on my skin. This foundation has a lot of clean ingredients and the finish is flawless. It is a fuller coverage for my mature skin but people say they don't even know I have foundation on. Color match is perfect and it makes my skin so soft. It blends effortlessly. I will never go back to my other product! This product is amazing and is a great purchase for the price. I love the wide range of shades and i finally found a tone that isnt to yellow or orange. The coverage is amazing but its also feels light on the skin and doesnt make my acne worse. Incredible product! This foundation looked promising and the reviews convinced me, but it made my face look like a desert, dry and dusty. I tried apply with brush was meh. Then i tried with beauty blender but makes it patchy. I will be returning I've been wanting to try this foundation for some time. The first I bought was too light. Ulta is always so great about returns and exchanges. I bought the correct shade and I love the full coverage it provides. Unsure if it was the product or inability to be matched properly. I am Hispanic. Tried 4 different shades: 310, 315, 330, 360! It did provide a flawless look which is why I kept trying for a good match! Not for me sadly! I love that it's the perfect color match Every time I wear, I breakout. I even got a really bad allergic reaction on my chin. I bad to throw it away. Switched back to my old foundation and the breakouts stopped. At first it applies well but it oxidizes This foundation is absolutely horrible. I tried everything to attempt to like this foundation since it had such good reviews but it isnt good for anyone who has dry or acne prone skin at all. Trying to cover acne is near impossible when it just comes off with every layer you try to build. It looks dry and patchy on moisturized skin. Even after the first application i noticed some break outs and soon after that it gave me the largest pimples ive had in years. My skin is clogged and feels/looks terrible after using this. I tried to like it so bad but after a few weeks of attempting to wear it i can say it's absolutely not good. Returned and went right back to Nars. This foundation is absolutely horrible.

I have used this foundation in the past and absolutely loved it, but recently my usual brand was out so I was recommended this foundation as a similar replacement. I was color matched in store and was happy with the color but as I began to regularly use this product it would look very dry and patchy on my skin. The color definitely oxidizes after it dries down another shade. I've also been very diligent with my skin care and my skin was looking better than ever but since using this product for a little over a month ive been having horrible acne breakouts even on my neck where I don't normally get acne where I would blend down the foundation. My face feels clogged and dry after using this foundation and i feel it has set back the results ive worked hard to acheive. I returned it and went right back to my usual.

This makeup matches, my color perfectly, and the coverage is amazing! Its an amazing foundation This is by far my favorite foundation. It somehow feels light on the skin and provides full coverage. A little goes a long way and the bottle lasts for quite a while. Even after wearing all day and sweating, it does not feel cakey and heavy. I definitely recommend! I use with a moist sponge for a beautiful dewey finish. Since I was 16, every 6 weeks I bought a different brands lightest shade that was always supposedly neutral pale tone. Until I spent the money to get a nice foundation, Everytime I was always much too tan or pink. Almost like a rocket pop of different colors. Now at 24 I will never go cheap on foundation again, and as long as my shade remains I'll only buy Fenty since it lasts for several months. If you're thinking about getting it, trust me it's worth your money. It oxidizes so bad, totally different from initial finish look This foundation is so amazing. I was looking for a full coverage/matte foundation that didnt feel thick and uncomfortable throughout the day and Rhiana pulled through with this one. It blends so beautifully with other liquid and powder products and lasts through long days. It smooths out my skin soooo well. I would defiently recomment this foundation if you want a foindation that doesnt feel heavy and uncomfortable throughout the day, makes you skin look smooth and gorgeous, blends soooo well with other products, lasts a long time, and is decently affordable but high end and good quality. For some reason this is the only foundation thay will not blend into my skin it just slides. Even with the correct primer it just blotches and sits. Its so strange because no other has done this. I want to love it, the coverage is great just not how it sits. I bought this concealer because of the good reviews. It looked really good after first applying it with a sponge after two hours. It's coming off all over my face and looks like it's caked on. I wasted my money and I will not buy again. I have been using this product for a couple of years now, since 2023
I love how it covers my skin imperfections 
It is smooth 
Not caky at all The coverage is so so good, the shade range is huge and its acne safe (for my skin). This kind of sat in my pores and creases. I returned it this is my go to foundation for less intense makeup looks. i wear a lot of bold goth makeup, but when i dont want to do
that, this is a good foundation. it has good coverage (though i tend to have pretty clear skin). i can barely feel it on my skin honestly. overall very good product! Loved it! This was drying so fast on my face that i couldn't even blend it at all. Decided to try this foundation as I've been doing the tinted moisturizers for some time. This foundation is amazing. Leaves my skin looking flawless. Better yet, I don't need a loose powder over it! Got a lot of compliments! I love this foundation and have used it foe years. Why did yall get rid of shade 105! It was my perfect shade!!! None others come close I've been buying this product for some time now and all of a sudden the last 2 that have dropped  broke and that had never happened before when accidentally dropped. I used to love this product a lot. But I am not sure if they have changed the formula. It is not the same as it used to be. Great foundation with decent coverage but yet still a light foundation that doesn't feel cakey. Definitely recommend trying if you are looking for a new foundation! Love it The finish on this foundation is matte and last on my skin throughout the day depending on what powder I use after and with proper skin preparation. It does dry down fast so blending quickly is crucial. The packaging is sleek, clean, and nice compared to drugstore foundations. I would buy this foundation again and recommend it to those with oily skin types looking for a matte foundation. MUA here to tell you to please swatch this formula and let it dry for 10 minutes before purchasing and watch how the color changes before purchasing to make sure it still works for you.  It will continue to get darker as well as warm up.   This product works best for people with strong warm / golden undertones who want full coverage. If you have neutral or cool / pink / red undertones, dry skin, sensitive skin, or foundation easily turns you orange, this may not be for you. Please see a beauty advisor in store for this one, folks. Love this foundation, it stays on all day and doesn't come off on my clothes. This foundation comes out the tube so thin, it doesn't cover anything. Then throughout the day it fades away and clings to imperfections on your face. Goes on light and about 90% full coverage. I'm new to trying a matte finish, and not sure of I'm a fan but I love that it's long lasting. The color is nice and consistent with my face. Seperates Seperates I am 42 and my skin is oily. I've tried all the best foundations and this one is the most blurring I've used and makes me look 10 years younger. I used il makiage primer underneath and it really makes my skin flawless! I accidentally bought this instead of the luminous one. After 4 hours the foundation was patchy. I used Smashbox Photo Finish primer and Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray. My skin is normal, not dry or oily. I dermaplane religiously and my skin is smooth. Im really disappointed. I hope the luminous one is better because im exchanging it tomorrow.",3.785,200
Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Moisturizing Cream with Squalane,"This doesn’t absorb and makes me look really greasy. Not sure why the positive reviews. The most incredible moisturizer I’ve ever used! Very moisturizing and after using for only a short time, I’ve noticed a huge difference in how my face and neck feel and look! It’s worth every dime. I’ve been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 for a while now, and it truly feels like a little luxury in my skincare routine. The texture is rich and silky, yet it absorbs quickly without leaving my skin greasy. Right after applying, my face feels smooth, hydrated, and has a healthy glow that lasts throughout the day. I also love that it has SPF 25, so I can use it as my daytime moisturizer and know I’m getting extra protection. Over time I noticed my skin looking a bit firmer and more even, especially around the jawline and smile lines. It also works really well under makeup, almost like a primer, keeping my foundation fresh without making it cakey. The only thing to note is the fragrance – it’s noticeable, though I personally find it pleasant.

Also another drawback, be aware that it will darken more towards orangish hue on the face and neckor whereever else it is put on the skin!

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I didn’t get the hype for this one. I didn’t see anything special changes to my skin and I didn’t notice it being ultra hydrating or anything like that. The added spf was nice but spf 30 would have been better. I don’t think it is worth the high price tag. For reference I have dry skin. 

I received this product for free from Topbox marketing for testing and review purposes. It was moisturizing, but that’s about it. I am really disappointed and did not see any changes in my skin.

The texture is rich yet lightweight, absorbing quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It leaves my skin feeling deeply moisturized, smooth, and noticeably firmer. There's a subtle, luxurious scent that adds to the overall experience without being overpowering.

What stands out the most is how radiant and plump my skin looks after consistent use. It feels like my skin has more bounce and elasticity, and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softer. It also works well under makeup, providing a smooth base without pilling.

I have also noticed major improvement to my skin since I started using this. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Great product, it has very thick texture so if you have oily skin I wouldn’t recommend it. But for dry skin it’s amazing, very moisturizing and has spf which is always a plus.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I received this product from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I love this moisturizing cream so much; it blends well into my skin and does not feel greasy, leaving my skin looking so beautiful. recommend to everyone. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 Moisturizer for about 3.5 weeks, and while it's too early to see significant changes (the brand recommends 12 weeks for optimal results), I've already noticed some great benefits. My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays
Keep in mind that everyone's skin type is different, so your experience may vary. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing how it works for me in the long run. 
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Awesome product, a little greasy feeling when you first put it on, but it soaks into the skin good. I love this Estée Lauder moisturizing cream!
I've been using it for over a week now, and it’s incredibly hydrating which is perfect for my dry skin. One of the things I enjoy most is how well it blends with my foundation or skin tints. It doesn't feel heavy at all, which is a big plus. It also has a light, pleasant fragrance that I personally like. While I’ve only used it for a short time, I’m hopeful it will deliver the long-term, youthful benefits it promises. So far, it’s been a great addition to my skincare routine!

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Thick product. Scented.

I appreciate that it is not very strongly scented. After a few days of use I feel my skin is smoother, softer and more supple. Will continue to use to see if I can prevent more wrinkles. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. A lot of product in container. Goes on very thick. It’s really scented, which could cause me problems in future. As a mom in my 30s, Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème SPF 25 has been a game-changer. It hydrates, firms, and gives my skin a radiant glow—while also protecting it with SPF. Feels luxurious, but absorbs quickly, and fits perfectly into my busy routine. Love that it does so much in one step! I’ve been using this product for around 2 weeks and it has become a staple in my skincare routine. It’s a lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I highly recommended. This product was given by Topbox Marketing for reviewing purposes.

There is also a sent with this product. It's a light sunscreen sent which my skin doesn't seem to mind at all! I love the added bonus that theres SPF 25 in the moisturizer for days that I forget to put my sunscreen on. Overall a great product! A luxury moisturizer that instantly enhances & improves your appearance. The quailty and texture of the Estee Lauder revitalizing moisturizer is truly unmatched. While I have been using this product, my skin feels and looks like Ive been aging backwards. My skin is more even, pores have minimized, fine lines reduced next to nothing & my skin is tighter and so smooth. My skin no longer feels and looks dull. My skin looks youthfully radiant, healthy, & hydrated. The product absorbs smoothly, and feels so good on my skin. Because of the high quality ingredients a little goes a long way when applying it. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. The texture is rich but sinks in effortlessly, leaving my skin soft and refreshed. After a few days, I noticed a visible glow and firmness. It layers well under makeup and feels super nourishing.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I absolutely love Estee Lauder.  I normally wear their Resilience Multi-Effect Moisturizer Tri-Peptide Face and Neck Creme SPF 15, however I'm finding it a little heavy for Spring/Summer.  This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.  I still stick with my Resilience Multi-Effect Night cream on top of my Advanced Night Repair serum.  
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. WOW🤩 the texture of this cream is just A DREAM! Its thick but soft, can feel how protects my skin, leaving this light barrier.

It has a rich creamy texture that hydrates so well without leaving my skin greasy! I use this as a day cream and night cream and the hydration and softness lasts all day! I love how radiant my skin looks after using this and my makeup applies beautiful on top of this. I'm rather picky when it comes to moisturizers and this is a winner! It gives my skin luminosity and a lifted look! Highly recommend! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. ⭐ Rating: 5/5

I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for a few weeks now, and my skin is obsessed. It’s rich but not heavy, melts in beautifully, and gives me that soft, bouncy feel with zero greasiness. The hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day, and I’ve noticed my skin looks smoother and more radiant—like I actually got 8 hours of sleep. Perfect under makeup, too. Total glow-up in a jar!

Would absolutely repurchase.✨ I received this from #topbox and Estee Lauder 
The cream is nice and creamy. My skin is so dehydrated that I need that extra moisture daily. I used it at night, and my face felt so soft. Let's hope in time the results are going to be noticed. I received this product for free from Topbox for review and testing purposes.
I absolutely love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft, smooth, and hydrated. Since I started using it, I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant. The hyaluronic acid delivers a great hydration boost without making my skin feel greasy. Highly recommend! I have received this product from Topbox, the cream is thick and slightly oily and also have fragrance. I have applied it during the night and day, as I have combination skin I felt it was oily and it will works better for me in winter than in summer. But I will continue to use in the night and I like the texture of the moisturizer. It would be good if the product does not have any fragrance. One this I like about the product is on applying, it gets absorbed into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave any white cast like the regular sunscreen. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I can't say much. However, I have really sensitive skin, and when I use it, no irritation or breakouts. Which is very important to me as I have crazy reactions to products I recieve this product for free from topbox for review and testing purpose.Love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight and leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and hydrated. I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant since using it. The hyaluronic acid gives a great hydration boost without feeling greasy. Definitely a new favorite! I can’t believe I’ve only just discovered this moisturizer. First of all, it has SPF 25, which is a huge bonus, especially for those quick moments I am out for a short period of time, when I forget sunscreen. Knowing my skin is protected even during those times is such a relief.
As a moisturizer, it’s absolutely divine. It glides on like silk, feels luxurious, and leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. The scent is subtle but lovely—clean and elegant, not overpowering.
Also, I worry about breakouts when trying new products and none at all for this. My skin has been loving this. I use it every morning, and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day without getting greasy.
I’m genuinely so happy with this purchase and already planning to restock once I run low. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new moisturizer.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I have found my new staple. I love how it has spf along with a great moisturization.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This product has a very soft baby touch like consistency. It smells like sunscreen and is in a very nice container. When I put it on my skin it blended into my skin very seamlessly it does seem to have a white cast when you blend it in but with a lot of blending it disappears right away! I received this for free from TopBox circle marketing. This moisturizer is a dream. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and looks noticeably firmer and more radiant. The texture is luxurious, absorbing beautifully without any greasiness. Plus the added SPF 25 is fantastic for daily protection. It's truly a powerhouse for youthful, healthy-looking skin.I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. If you have sensitive skin, this is not the product for you.  This creme had a strong fragrance and was very irritating to my skin.  After one use, I developed a severe puritic rash that was uncomfortable.  It took about 2 weeks to resolve after needing to use a typical steroid. i used my points for a sample and it broke my face out bad...thing is not much breaks my out so I was surprised Hydration and Results From the first use, my skin felt instantly hydrated and softer. Over a few weeks, I noticed a more plumped appearance and a slight reduction in fine lines. It’s deeply nourishing without clogging pores, making it a good choice for people with normal to dry skin. For those with very oily skin, it might feel a little too heavy. It’s a nice moisturizer, but frankly I’ve used better for less money. Not worth the money. It’s a thick cream in texture but I don’t find it very moisturizing. 
I’d stick with Clarins. I received this product in error from Sephora and am glad I did. I am 49 and my skin looks dehydrated after 2 hours of using anything. I put on my SPF, this moisturizer and then Tatcha Dewy Skin Mist and my skin (picture below) is plump and dewy 7 hours after application! I had a disappointing experience with this face cream. Unfortunately, I reacted poorly to it, resulting in significant swelling around my eyes and hives all over my face. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product. I received a sample of this and immediately bought a full size, amazing for mature skin- the scent is pleasant and does not bother me at all. I'm using the sample and already see results. will definitely buy full size. I just received it today and as a woman who suffers from migraines I cannot stand the perfume smell. It is suffocating. It’s not a natural “we’ve mixed all these wonderful ingredients to make your skin great” it’s a bottle of perfume in lotion form that will dry your skin because of it! This product did just nothing. Very overpriced. Smells really good but nothing more to say. Worst porches i ever had Every time I washed my face and using this I broke out Unfortunately this product irritated my skin. it's hit and miss when my skin reacts to products. after application within a couple hours, it started as a tingle and then started burning. Definitely not the product for me. I never write reviews but I got this in a holiday set back in Dec. I just finished using the product and had to repurchase. It’s now a staple. My skin has never felt so soft!! This came in the Advanced Night holiday set from Estee Lauder that was an INCREDIBLE value. I have tried this particular product several times now and it's just meh. Lackluster. I wouldn't recommend or purchase. Absolutely love the results of this product but the fragrance is a deal breaker. Why do they have to do that!! My face has never felt or looked better but even the slightest smell gives me a headache and you can smell it come out when you work out which ends up burning my eyes I've used this for year off and on. And will probably keep going back to it. lol It's one of the only creams that actually hydrate my super dry skin. My only gripe is the scent. Smells like old lady perfume, which I suppose is expected from an older brand like Estee Lauder. The only comparable face cream I have found is the Tacha Dewy Face Cream (Which smells soooo much better. Very light, refreshing scent.). So I flip-flop between the two. I had over 100 points I decided to try this moisturizer wow!!! Leaves my face like a baby !!! Now i see why the bigger size is expensive but its worth it leaves my skin so smooth love it!!! Been using since my 20’s so it’s been a little more than a decade. Clearly looks like I’m in my 20’s when I’m not. so I’m a loyal loyal user. Celebrity brands come and go, but this creamy delicious cream is a forever in my routine for the rest of my life. I’m obsessed ￼with this! I use it in the morning , it makes your skin so soft and buttery goes perfect under spf and drunk elephant bronze drops. My skin overall is much plumper and smooth. I got a sample of this moisturizer and I am in love. It feels so nice, smells nice and really moisturizes my skin. After using this product over the last week, I can say it’s definitely not for me. I got the mini size with my points so I’m glad I was able to trial it. I’ve got really clear skin and it broke me out. The smell is nice but I’m not a fan of scents in my skincare. It feels really nice and luxurious on my skin. I use the Sephora skincare which is clean and I absolutely love it, will be sticking with that. I love this cream. It is silky smooth and combined with my anti-aging serum of choice, this face cream is wonderful. I received this as a sample.  It was mid winter, my hands were red, chapped and splitting from what I've no clue.  I used this on them once and they were healed within the hour.  My face is way to sensitive for me to put anything on it, but this is fabulous if you have painful red winter hands. Perfect moisturizer for my sensitive, fair, dry skin, lasts all day, winter and summer. No dry patches. No reactions. The scent is subtle. Skin is visibly smoother, more plump and radiant. 5stars This is a great moisturizer but the biggest issues for me were the fragrance which lasts a while and that it’s irritating to my eyes especially if I sweat later in the day. I think Rose Ingleton’s moisturizer is a great frangance free alternative especially if you want a moisturizer with less fragrance I have dry, pigmented skin, and this has worked wonders. Literally gives me a filter effect. ￼ I got this as a complementary gift when I ordered mascara from Estée Lauder. It is over the top when it comes to fragrance. It goes on thick, but does not hydrate. Not a fan whatsoever. I use it on my legs now My combination skin love this stuff so far and gives a nice silky smooth feel. So far so good. I liked this moisturizer and it made my skin dewy and supple. However, it was a little too thick for me, especially during the summer months. Better for winter or very dry skin, probably. Overall very nice and smells good too!
I received this product complimentary in exchange for a fair review. Lovely cream that moisturizes and brightens my complexion! This moisturizer is a good option.  I received a free sample to test out and review from influenster. I am not sure of the long term impact but short term, I’ve had good results.  It’s a thicker formula so I found myself using a little more product but it’s a rich, hydrating formula. It is scented and isn’t my favorite scent (perfumed scent) but it does dissipate pretty quickly.  This works best when washed before each time you apply. I break out pretty easily but this didn’t break me out which is great. I loved the texture of this moisturizer. When applying it to my skin, I felt that it went on super smooth. Despite being a cream type, it absorbed completely into my skin without any greasiness. I have combination skin and this seemed to help with some of the dry patches that sometimes pop up from time to time. In addition, the scent was light and refreshing - a winning combination. Let me start by saying that I am not one to splurge on beauty products unless I hear AMAZING things about it. So let me just tell you that after testing a sample of this product for a couple of weeks, I am ready to splurge on the full size product!!

My skin is definitely showing signs of “maturing” at forty years old. I have tried a lot of products over the past few years, both high end and drug store (you know the drug store brand commercials…”better than the $100 cream”). Truth be told, none of the products I have tried for my maturing, combination skin, have blown me away. That is, until this little baby came along. It’s weightless, and makes your skin feel soooo smooth. I love that it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I am definitely noticing a decrease in fine lines.

If you are showing signs of aging skin, give this product a try! I received a small sample of Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I loved using this moisturizer! It's thick and luxurious and felt great on my oily skin. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this moisturizer. I used this mostly in the AM for a little over a week. It is lightly scented but that didn't bother me. I can't speak to the long-term benefits since I only used this for a short time but I would love to continue using this moisturizer! I love Estee Lauder, it works perfectly for my skin, I never had any problems or issues with this brand. The moisturizer is great, now that the air got soooo dry in Texas, I must have a good moisturizer. I apply it ok face and neck, in the morning and at night. The skin feels good, as it feels very dry after washing it. I received a sample of this in exchange for an honest review. It was too small to see the long term effects of the product, but I definitely noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin looked and felt. I tend to get very dry when the weather starts to get colder but this definitely helped keep that at bay. I thought the event was light and really nice, and I am usually sensitive to heavily scented products. I especially love that a refill pot is available to save on packaging waste. The packaging is lovely has has a luxe look to it as well. Love this! My skin gets very dry in cold weather and I noticed a huge difference with only 1 use. A little goes a long way and it’s definitely moisturizing. I received this from moisturizer for free from Estēe Lauder and Influenster. Unfortunately when I began to use it I broke out. It has a light fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly. It has a creamy texture that goes onto the skin beautifully. I would have to try it again to see if it continues to cause breakouts. I liked it so much that I used it completely in a week.  I liked how it left my face soft and hydrated.  It has a super soft texture that does not leave the skin greasy.  its aroma is also super light.  Too bad it was a very small sample.  but I am happy to have tried it for sure I will buy it later.  highly recommended.  I really liked the packaging, both the material and its color make it look very elegant. I was excited to try this item. It did not have a oily look or texture. It was easy to use and after a few days I felt that I could see a change with some of my face wrinkles. I loved this product, after using only few days i started to notice changes on my skin. It made my skin to feel firmer and started vanishing wrinkles. More glowing and younger look skin! Recommend it! This is a thick and heavy cream but it does absorb pretty quickly after applying. It does leave my skin feeling oily for longer than I would prefer. I have tried other Estee lauder moisturizers and this is not one I would repurchase because it did not work for my personal preferences. After using this product I did not notice a difference in my skins appearance. I found the cream to be a bit thick and not very hydrating. There are better products on the market. Received this as a trial from Influenster for an honest review.  So glad to have had the opportunity to try it too!This moisturizer was very good. I typically have normal skin but as the weather changes it tends to get drier in the cooler months. I find that this definitely helps keep my skin from feeling dry. It absorbs very well, has a light scent, non-greasy yet makes skin supple and hydrated.  I liked it very much and I think at this price point it’s worth it! I really love the way this makes my skin feel. I think it’s too soon to see any visible results which is why I only gave 4 stars but it definitely feels like it’s doing something and I’m excited about it. I received this complimentary to test and love it. It doesn’t have an oily feel at all and makes my skin feel very moisturized. I am not huge into scents but this one is light. I received a small sample of this cream from Influenster to review. I think the sample was a bit small to test it’s anti aging properties. However, so far I really like how it is feeling on my skin. Works wells with my combo skin - enough moisture for the stubborn dry parts. But not too much or clogging my more oily parts. I plan on purchasing a regular size one to truly test the anti aging claims. I got this complimentary from influenster and i love it. Only receieved a small sample jar but it definitely makes me wana buy full size. My skin is dry n gets worse when fall and winter hit, this made my face feel soft and hydrated. Anything with hyaluronic acid in it sign me up You definitely can feel the luxury from the packaging to the feeling of the thick and moisturizing cream. Worked really well under makeup for me. Unfortunately with the trial size I received I don’t think I had enough time to see long term benefits, but it definitely feels nice and moisturizing. Love love love it!! Made my skin look so amazing!! Some one asked if I had Botox!! Get it now! I don’t have any wrinkles or fine lines, so I can’t speak to how it works for those, but it is a great moisturizer. It isn’t heavy or sticky. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, kind of a basic “skin care” scent. I love this product it made my face feel so good and it is definitely a plus to put on before makeup your makeup looks so much better on your face I have combination skin, mostly dry throughout the day, especially in the morning. I have to use a skin moisturizer. I don’t use it everyday, but sometimes my skin is in need of a miracle, even my eyelids feel dry. After using the moisturizer it left my face looking very refreshed. My face felt hydrated and it didn’t have that tightness feeling that comes with dry skin. I also was complemented that I looked younger after apply this product to my face. Amazing but expensive. Left mt skin feeling healthy the times I had the chance to test it. My skin looked healthy and young and my makeup jus amazing.. 100% Recommended if you have the opportunity to put your hands on This cream is magical. It absorbs quickly, softens my skin, is non-sticky, lightweight, without any chemical smell. It seems like my skin improved a lot since I started using it: I noticed much less breakouts and more glow and hydration. I use the cream with serum(for extra hydrations and redness relief on my cheeks).
Great cream for everyday use! He uses it every day. The Ultra facial cream has given me super smooth soft skin! The rich moisture this product gives is amazing and my face always looks and feels refreshed once applied. It is now a staple in my routine; along with the milk peel gentle exfoliating toner! Super hydrating moisturizer! Always works really well. Wanted to love this moisturizer as I love most other Kiehl's products, but it unfortunately made me breakout, and I don't breakout easily. The formula is lightweight and definitely moisturizes, but unfortunately I will have to stop using. good experience and its my stock product whole year round the facial cream is amazing! the moisture and the glow is unmatched! This product leaves my skin so soft, glowy, and hydrated! This is a great moisturizer for all skin types. It will leave your skin feeling hydrated without a heavy feeling. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth, a great base for any products I apply after. love this product! i wish it was a little thicker for my really dry skin but overall love it I love this moisturizer! I had recebtly switched to cerave after using this and all I can say is that I couldn't wait to switch back to Kiehl's. I had high hopes with this and their HA serum. It's nice and light with no fragrance but unfortunately doesn't hydrate my skin. This moisturizer has been a godsend! My skin feels amazing, I have been using this for only a couple of weeks and instantly have seen a difference. I am using Tretnoin and this has drastically helped with the dryness from that. My skin barrier has been restored, and I will continue to buy this. Best moisturizer I've used that was not prescribed by dermatologist. You do not need a lot. Provides long lasting moisture. I have fair sensitive skin and have mot had any issues. Used for 3 months. I bought this for my husband and it has been the only moisturizer that actually keeps his skin hydrated for 24 hours. Gives my  face moisture without clogging pores. I have normal to dry skin, acne and sensitive. Im usually a Biosassance moisturizer but needed something a tad lighter. This was it especially during hot days for me. I usually get it on sale! The texture feels like cross breed with gel moisturizer and a heavy moisturizer. It does contain dimethicone for that slip. My skin was not irritated to it! Love the feeling very light This has become my favorite moisturizer & have been using it for a few years now. I have tried SO many others but always come back to this one. I do have one other favorite but this one is best for me & for my sensitive skin, lightweight & soothing. My sikn turns read very easily even if a product is for sensitive skin! But this right here did not disappoint!! Little goes a long way!!!! Definitely worth every cent! No irritation or burning AT ALL which is hard to find for my skin! Just made my second purchase. I ran out a face cream I used to use  and needed a face cream really bad and quick so I stopped at ulta and came across KIEHL'S face cream. I read the reviews on the ulta app and saw that it had many good reviews and its good for sensitive skin, so I bought it. once I applied the face cream to my face, I fell in love with the cream! I have sensitive skin so I always get scared if a face cream will start burning my skin but this was smooth, super hydrating, hydration lasts all day, and no smell at all which is perfect. This is my new face cream and little goes a long way! this brand is amazing This is a very reliable moisturizer for me. I already know it works for my sensitive skin and doesnt break me out. I dont consider it the most moisturizing cream that i tried but it gets the job done. Also works great under makeup. This product wasnt as thick as I would've liked it but it absorbs well and is for dry skin. This is definitely an everyday face moisturizer. This works real well for my skin. I've tried other products and none have worked as well as this one. It's a little expensive, but for me a little goes a long way. I have super picky and sensitive skin, and this was the moisturizing answer it needed. The texture is really nice and creamy, it doesn't pill, and there is almost no noticeable smell to it. Emphasized my pores and blackhead, not worth it especially for the price point. This product is a miracle, I had undergone radiation treatment for cancer and that had left my skin super dry and after using Kiehl's after a week I've noticed a dramatic difference. It's definitely a no-frills but quality moisturizer, so unsure why it's so expensive. Will be looking for other options that are cheaper but would pick up if a good sale. I really enjoy this product cause i was suffering with dry skin and now it's super hydrating and soft. I like it's not greasy at all and there's no fragrance. My daughter and I love this product. We do the 30min drive to Ulta in a different town just to buy it. Definitely beats the other creams we have tried. it broke me out really bad I was a Peter Thomas Roth water drench cream fan for its light feel and hydration, but it's expensive. I thought this give Kielhs a try and I love it (and the lower price!). I use to have to shave my face everyday to get all the access skin off because of my acutane making my skin dry, this moisturizer helped a lot. I was able to put on makeup with out it being patchy, it is VERYY thick and best for over night use. Great product Soooo I've got dry skin. This is a new thing for me as I spent 24 years having oily skin and then BAM you hit 25 and it's dry. Now I'm a black girl and if its one thing my momma taught me it was how to moisturize. I don't feel like this product does enough for it to be priced the way it is. I do not feel it offers superior moisture or leaves my skin looking better than my KPL LPS lotion. It's nice sure, feels great, but what are the real benefits that make it worth so much? I've been using this for about 6 months now and I just dont feel like it's giving me the moisture. I love this product! Helps with break outs. I haven't broke out in months! And my face is so glowy! This does give moisture to your skin but ive noticed it does peel up into little balls if you rub your skin and that drives me crazy. So maybe not the best under makeup. Its very pricey too! The lettering also seems to come off the container when using very quickly which is interesting. I received a sample of this and didn't expect much, but wow. I am oleasantky surprised. It is very moisturizing and lightweight. A little goes anlong way. I will definitely purchase in rhe future. I love how this makes my skin feel not only today but every day after I am so so impressed! I got it during the sale with 50% off and I am so happy! Leaves my skin so soft. The moisturiser is silky smooth, and doesn't break me out. Very pleased! This moisturizer has been my go-to for over five years now, and it never ceases to provide my skin with the moisture it needs. Absorbs nicely. Never greasy, and not irritating. I'll never stop using it. I use it all year. This is the only moisturizer that truly works for my facial dermatitis. It is a must for dry winters in Wisconsin. I got the jar first and i loved the texture. Also, it is perfect for dry winters or locations. Hydrates perfectly. However, i bought the refill bag and i found that the texture was different. It was heavier and thicker. And im not sure about this but i had some reaction because some parts of my face were itchy and had small pimples. So im not sure if i got a bad batch. Keeps my skin hydrated and glowing! Feels lightweight. I use it mornings and nights. Love this moisturizer for the dry winters bought this because of the raving reviews and first thought was the price for the size is insane! la Roche posay moisturizer is 10x better and bigger for the price! second thought was it feels kinda greasy feeling on my face and doesn't really absorb that well. would I buy again? absolutely not. I bought on sale for 50% off and still wouldn't do that again. Ok… im in love with this product! Hands down the BEST moisturizer ive ever used. Its so light on your skin and goes on super smooth. Leaves my skin soo soft and moistured. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this isn't irritating at all. Its just so expensive ☹️ With formula change now peeling is inevitable and is a deal breaker for me. Before this was never an issue but now seems to be. I have combination skin so i have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out. I received a sample size to try, loved it so much bought a full size. Yes, it pricey, but a little goes a long way. I really enjoyed using this. It's a nice consistency, not too thick or too thin and I find a little goes a long way. I have combination oily skin and my skin really drinks this up in the winter. My face does feel oily/greasy after a few hours though, and if I have flaky patches, it doesn't do wonders or anything. Good staple to come back to if needed. The search continues! I use it as a night cream and my skin soaks it up better than other night creams. It might be too moist for daytime use, so I'd recommend buying the travel size first to see if it's for you, but I highly recommend it. I have combination skin that is both dry, oily and sensitive in certain areas on my face. i'm so glad I made the purchase and tried it out. I use this product religiously and have seen so much improvement! My dry skin loves this moisturizer, it also has great humectant ingredients. This moisturizer is amazing, it is my new forever purchase. Although its a bit pricey, this is my holy grail moisturizer. Does the job and doesn't break me out whatsoever! I was excited to try this despite the high price. I have combination skin- dry in the winter, but my forehead and cheeks can get oily. This product felt good going on, but my skin, especially my cheeks, turned super red after use and stayed that way all day. I decided to stick with it for a couple days to see if my skin adjusted. Within a couple days of once daily use I had bad breakouts, as well. I'm 41 and typically have clear skin. This also made my forehead extremely greasy feeling, even if I only used a small amount there. I'm going to return it, even though I like the eye cream that came with it as a free gift. Feels nice & hydrates my mature skin. Works well under makeup. I have the most sensitive skin and have tried brands from, the outset, first aide beauty, tatcha , inn beauty , sunday riley, etc etc. they all break me out but not this stuff . I glow and my skin is so soft and i never ever break out. Love it so much! Cant go wrong with this stuff! This started burning immediately. It burned so bad I washed it off right away. So painful. I dont have any kind of skin condition. Never using again I have had trouble with eczema on my face and after I bought a perfume and got a tester of the lotion and it made my eczema go away and then after it ran out, my eczema came back so then I went to the store and bought a little travel size of it and it's been helping my eczema so much. It's amazing. The first time I tried this out was at the end of August in 2024 because I got it for my birthday gift. It's not greasy and it does the job. I have been using this for 4 years and will repurchase every time This unscented cream is light, spreads easily, hydrates, and feels so very good on my face! In the mirror, my skin looks smoother than before. got this as a sample for my birthday back in july. trust i will br buying again. makeup looks sooooo good with this moisturizer I've tried a ton of products, and this is by far one of my favorites! Ultra Facial Cream is so lightweight but hydrates my skin like no other face cream I've tried. It's a little bit pricey, but I definitely think it's worth it! Less packaging which means more product for my money. Love this facial cream!!! I don't feel like my face is dried out when I use this and my eyes do not burn from wearing it like other creams I have used! Very light i feel very moisturized Very light i feel very moisturized It hydrates very well and is non-tacky when dry. I'm still debating on whether it's making me break out (still haven't figure out what works best for me yet). For comparison, verse dew point gel also dries well, but I don't find it anywhere near as hydrating. My flare ups have been driving me crazy over the past few months, especially on my neck, but this moisturizer made a huge difference! My skin feels nourished, buttery, and NOT ITCHY. My breakouts have decreased and im starting to glow again! Not greasy, oily, & scent less! 
A quality facial cream! Moisturizes well and doesn't cause me to break out. I recieved this as a b-day gift from ulta and its totally changed my skin. My skin is extremely sensitive and hates most products. My skin was always oily and had dry patches on my nose despite using other moisturizers. Ever since ive started using this Khiels cream my skin is no longer oily, no more dry patches, super smooth and soft, and just overall looks healthier. And the cream keeps my face moisturized for days if i happen to forget to put it on. A little goes a long way as well and it absorbs quickly. Overall this cream feels luxurious and has completely changed my skin for the better. Its a bit pricey but completely worth it < 3 I recieved this as a b-day gift from ulta and its totally changed my skin. My skin is extremely sensitive and hates most products.

Overall this cream feels luxurious and has completely changed my skin for the better. Its a bit pricey but completely worth it < 3 I've been looking for a heavier day time moisturizer, and while i really like the way it feels and performs, it pills under make up making it unusable for me. I went back to this moisturizer after Murad products were drying out my skin and leaving them with a burning sensation. This Keihls Moisturizer is great for my sensitive skin. Fragrance Free. I have combination skin so my face gets a little oily around the T zone with it. I use oil blotting sheets and the problem is solved. I love this brand It was a staple in winter, but now it has Dimethicone and it pills under sunscreen I've been using this product for about a month now and my forehead is filled of blemishes and pimples which I never get. Not worth it too expensive even for the smallest one. This is my all time favorite moisturizer. I have very sensitive dry skin and as soon as I put this on after my cleansing, my face feels so smooth and well moisturized. I got this as a freebie for my birthday. About a month into using it, I have had the worst acne ever. Like- cystic acne that hurts so so bad. I have never experienced this. I will never ever buy the full size product, I threw the freebie away. Hoping my skin clears up soon, this is awful. At 36, I'm trying to retain as much moisture as possible; and this definitely helps! I use this along with the hyaluronic acid serum and the avocado eye treatment, and I love how my skin is make up optional as a result. Just a few dabs of this cream goes a long way. It feels very clean and pure on my face.  It is expensive but will last a long time. It moisturizes well, but I don't notice anything in particular with helping fine lines at all, is a good makeup base I got a sample for my birthday and fell in love with it! I have sensitive skin, so it's tough to find products that are not going to make me break into hives. It keeps moisture in the skin all day, so you do not have to worry about replying consistently, and it's great to use before putting makeup on. I tried this when it was at a great Christmas gift set price. The jars lasted me until September. I've started to look around for something new because I feel like I could find something a little more moisturizing. I'm 55 and I feel like I need something a little heavier.

But now that I'm trying other moisturizers, I have a new appreciation for this one! It absorbs very fast, there's no added perfume, it's light and refreshing, you dont have to tug at skin rubbing it in like a thicker cream,  there's no shiny face afterward. I have sensitive skin on my chest and it's never caused redness or any reaction at all.  I even use it as an eye cream without any problem. 

I didn't realize how hard that is to find! I've tried and returned 2 moisturizers already and I hate to do that. If I can't find a replacement soon, I'm seriously considering just sticking with this! I just started using this product, and my skin instantly feels smooth and hydrated. My foundation used to look patchy and cakey, but this product has helped prevent that so far. I'm definitely buying more of this! I recently started using tret & got a couple burns. This is so moisterizing, doesn't irritate my skin at all. Feels luxurious. A little pricey but I'll definitely repurchase! Very lightweight, but moisturizing. Love it!! I got this as a free sample at ulta..used for 2-3 days with huge expectations but i hate this so called hyped moisturizer…my skin became extremely dry after applying it..also it caused skin peeling I feel my skin face soft and looks healthy. I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from papulopustular rosacea, which lately has been confined mostly to my nose. I have used Clinique Gel Moisturizer for over 16 years, but it started making my rosacea worse recently and burning my skin.

I received a .95oz sample of this Kiehl's moisturizer from Ulta and was very happy with the ingredients list. I am even more happy with the results!! This moisturizer has transformed my skin. It's happy, clear and nothing in this irritates my skin. My skin LOVES this stuff. This is my new go-to. Even in the humid midwest summer heat, it doesn't clog pores and really does pull moisture into your skin. I'll be interested to see how it works in the winter but I am hoping for my best winter skin with this new product.

10/10 would change nothing except the price, but I'm saving money just by having healthy skin. don't be fooled. I thought this would be a nice simple, fragrance-free moisturizer for my acne prone combination skin. after 2 weeks of use I experienced whiteheads, oiliness, dryness/itchiness/irritation, texture EVERYWHERE and deep, cystic pimples that hurt to the touch. it hasn't been as bad since, but it took me 6 months and lots of adapelene to clear the acne and scars. I looked it up & my suspicions were confirmed- this ranks highly for comedogenic ingredients!! be careful and pls spare yourself if you have acne prone skin. im sure its a great moisturizer for other skin types. I picked this as my birthday gift and was glad I did. I have been having problems with dry skin and this makes my skin so moisturized and glowy i highly recommend this product This moisturizer broke my face out after 2 uses and took over 1 week to fully resolve. It basically caused tiny skin colored bumps all over my face. If you have senstive skin I wouldnt recommened! Very light weight and feels so good on my skin. I have extremely dry skin and psoriasis and it has helped tremendously with my dry patches. I hope this is never changed or discontinued. I've been struggling with skin issues that came out of nowhere. Acne, dryness, irritation, texture. I read online a lot of people with redness and rosacea said this worked for them, so I tried it, not with high hopes. I've tried nearly EVERYTHING. I can't even list all the moisturizers I've tried. They all irritate my skin and make me breakout or turn red or burn and sting. This stuff doesn't at all! Not only that, it's THE MOST MOISTURIZING PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED, hands down! On top of that, after a couple weeks, it's completely changed my skin. My skin looks literally like glass! It's SO SMOOTH, the texture is GONE, my pores are small and smooth, I have a glow that I've never had in my life and I'm 35! my skin is SO SOFT and supple. I will NEVER LET THIS STUFF GO. If they see this, please DONT CHANGE IT! I've tried them all from every brand and this is MILES BEYOND the rest. If you're considering trying it, try it! They do offer a small trial size (at least as of now). Not everything works for everyone, but try it! It is really good, i got pne for my ulta b-day present and i do not regret picking it at all and i have nevere used something better that this. I will definitely be buying this next time! Really lightweight, but still very moisturizing somewhat of a gel cream. I have really dry skin and it's basically brought my skin back to life. I love it and I'll definitely be purchasing it. i got this product 3-4 weeks ago and i havent been putting much makeup on and i noticed blemishes under  my eyes so i stoped using the cream and switched to cetaphil and the blemishes went away. I have used the product for several years. It is lightweight and easily absorbed. I wanted to love this because it makes your skin so soft and it feels weightless - but everytime I've used this product I seem to breakout :( For the last 3 years I've been using a moisturizer that costs $60 for 1.7oz. I tried this because I had a coupon for a free mini. I was hooked after the first use! No pilling, no balling up. It absorbs nicely and my skin feels phenomenal!! I wish I would've tried this moisturizer sooner! My skin looks so plump and hydrated. The texture of this cream is very lightweight, but still feels very moisturizing. I have balanced to dry skin and I am in my 40s. I could see someone with oily skin not liking this especially if their skin is very oily. I love the squalane in this moisturizer. This is my new go to moisturizer, not only is it less expensive than the one I've been using, but it's also much better!! I was skeptical about the price but I have heard so much about this product and I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and it is great! Consistency is good and it's soft on my skin. I would recommend it to anyone. BEST  FACIAL  CREAM  I  HAVE  EVER  USED I read other comments about it stinging when they put it on and should have listened. That being said, I do have sensitive skin, so if you don't I would still recommend this moisturizer.  It absorbs well and doesn't leave your face feeling greasy. Love this moisturizer. Layers great under sunscreen and makeup. Non greasy, doesn't pill, no fragrance. Will continue to buy over and over! Ive been buying this product consistently for 8 years. I cannot love this moisturizer more. I have eczema and very dry skin, and this keeps feeling moisturized all day. This moisturizer is definitely more expensive than other budget friendly options, but well worth it for me. I had the .95 oz jar to try it first, so I ordered the 8.5 oz jar because it is the cheapest option per oz. If I didn't order this from Ulta I would have assumed I was scammed. The jar quality of the 8.5 compared to the .95 jar was very poor. The label was a sticker as opposed to printed directly on the jar, and it was even on the jar crooked! A bit of a bummer that it doesnt feel as luxe as the smaller jar. After reading the reviews, I was curious and wanted to try this moisturizer for my dry skin if you have really dry skin, I do not recommend this at all I had to reapply this moisturizer more than once, just for it to moisturize my face it also for some reason peels out of my feet, and when I use make up with it, it starts peeling even worse than it looks hideous. I do not recommend this at all. After years of searching for a moisturizer for my combo skin I have finally found my Goldilocks moisturizer I have really sensitive skin and tried this moisturizer based on its high reviews, but it left my skin feeling irritated and dry after using. I would recommend trying another moisturizer if your skin is very sensitive like mine.",4.271428571428571,210
Lancôme Rénergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Cream,"This doesn’t absorb and makes me look really greasy. Not sure why the positive reviews. The most incredible moisturizer I’ve ever used! Very moisturizing and after using for only a short time, I’ve noticed a huge difference in how my face and neck feel and look! It’s worth every dime. I’ve been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 for a while now, and it truly feels like a little luxury in my skincare routine. The texture is rich and silky, yet it absorbs quickly without leaving my skin greasy. Right after applying, my face feels smooth, hydrated, and has a healthy glow that lasts throughout the day. I also love that it has SPF 25, so I can use it as my daytime moisturizer and know I’m getting extra protection. Over time I noticed my skin looking a bit firmer and more even, especially around the jawline and smile lines. It also works really well under makeup, almost like a primer, keeping my foundation fresh without making it cakey. The only thing to note is the fragrance – it’s noticeable, though I personally find it pleasant.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Amazing!! It’s super hydrating it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and not tacky or oily like some other skin products I would recommend highly. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. As a moisturizer it's fantastic, especially for dry skin types. Everything else is lies and falsehood!
Also another drawback, be aware that it will darken more towards orangish hue on the face and neckor whereever else it is put on the skin!  If that's not what you like, then choose wisly I've been using a lot of products for acne prone skin that have been very drying to the skin and this moisturizer is a god send!  Very hydrating and non-greasy!  I just wish the scent wasn't so overpowering! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes This moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin soft, smooth, and hydrated all day. It's perfect for daily use and works well even on sensitive skin. The formula feels gentle and refreshing, with no heavy residue. A great addition to any skincare routine! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I didn’t get the hype for this one. I didn’t see anything special changes to my skin and I didn’t notice it being ultra hydrating or anything like that. The added spf was nice but spf 30 would have been better. I don’t think it is worth the high price tag. For reference I have dry skin. 

I received this product for free from Topbox marketing for testing and review purposes. It was moisturizing, but that’s about it. I am really disappointed and did not see any changes in my skin. For the price tag I expected something special. I even think the added spf broke me out a bit (although I have extremely sensitive skin) I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This cream feels like a silky hug for my skin. The texture is rich without being heavy, and it sinks in beautifully without leaving a greasy finish. I noticed my skin felt plumper, more hydrated, and had that fresh, healthy glow by the next morning. The scent is light and elegant—just enough to make it feel luxurious. A little goes a long way, so even though it’s on the pricier side, it lasts. Perfect for anyone who wants to indulge in a moisturizer that actually delivers.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Loving this moisturizer for summer!
It goes on smoothly and feels very moisturizing on the skin. I love how it combines hydration with sun protection. After applying, my skin feels soft, hydrated and plum throughout the day. I’m beyond impressed with this moisturizer! I received this product for free from TopBox Circle for testing and review purposes. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème for a few weeks now, and I'm genuinely impressed. The texture is rich yet lightweight, absorbing quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It leaves my skin feeling deeply moisturized, smooth, and noticeably firmer. There's a subtle, luxurious scent that adds to the overall experience without being overpowering.

What stands out the most is how radiant and plump my skin looks after consistent use. It feels like my skin has more bounce and elasticity, and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softer. It also works well under makeup, providing a smooth base without pilling.

I have also noticed major improvement to my skin since I started using this. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Great product, it has very thick texture so if you have oily skin I wouldn’t recommend it. But for dry skin it’s amazing, very moisturizing and has spf which is always a plus.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I love this cream!!! This cream is very hydrating, light weight and it genuinely feels amazing on the skin. The fact that it also has sunscreen included makes it the perfect cream for everyday purposes. I have also noticed major improvement to my skin since I started using this. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I’ve been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 Moisturizer for the past couple of weeks, and it has quickly become a part of my morning skincare routine.

The texture is rich but not greasy, and it absorbs into my skin beautifully without leaving a white cast from the SPF.

The light, pleasant scent makes the experience even better, as it feels like a little luxury every morning.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes I received this product from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I love this moisturizing cream so much; it blends well into my skin and does not feel greasy, leaving my skin looking so beautiful. recommend to everyone. I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme SPF 25 Moisturizer for about 3.5 weeks, and while it's too early to see significant changes (the brand recommends 12 weeks for optimal results), I've already noticed some great benefits. My skin feels incredibly hydrated, looks healthier, and has a lovely glow. I appreciate the SPF 25, which saves me from worrying about applying separate sunscreen.
One thing to note is that the cream can feel slightly heavy and greasy when first applied, but it absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving no residue behind.
Overall, I'm impressed with this moisturizer, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, hydrating cream with SPF protection. The combination of hyaluronic acid, moringa extract, and peptides seems to be doing wonders for my skin, and I'm excited to see the long-term results.
Some key benefits of this product include:
Hydration: Provides 72-hour hydration and strengthens the skin's moisture barrier
Anti-aging: Helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity
SPF Protection: Offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA/UVB rays
Keep in mind that everyone's skin type is different, so your experience may vary. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing how it works for me in the long run. 
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Awesome product, a little greasy feeling when you first put it on, but it soaks into the skin good. I love this Estée Lauder moisturizing cream!
I've been using it for over a week now, and it’s incredibly hydrating which is perfect for my dry skin. One of the things I enjoy most is how well it blends with my foundation or skin tints. It doesn't feel heavy at all, which is a big plus. It also has a light, pleasant fragrance that I personally like. While I’ve only used it for a short time, I’m hopeful it will deliver the long-term, youthful benefits it promises. So far, it’s been a great addition to my skincare routine!
 
I received this product free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I gave this to my mother to try it out and so far she said it is good. Though she thinks with prolonged use it will help with her skin more. She has also mentioned it is lightweight on her skin and is not heavy which she likes. Definitely recommend. This moisturizer feel reach and smooth on the skin it keeps my face hydrated all day and adds a nice glow I like that it has SPF 25 for sun protection it also works well under makeup the scent is a bit strong but overall it’s a good great product great product I’ve been using this cream for a while, and my skin does feel hydrated. It has a sunscreen-like texture, which I’m not a fan of, but it’s not that bad. I think it’s a nice product to add to a morning routine, and I would recommend it.

I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Thick product. Scented. A good product to put on overnight and let soak into skin I absolutely loved this moisturizer! I usually break out when I try new products on my face but it didn’t happen with this one. This product is very moisturizing and also has spf in it which is amazing! I loved this and will be purchasing again ! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I love that  it leaves my skin hydrated while also improving firmness. It absorbs well, softens fine lines, and leaves my skin looking  more youthful. It is a bit pricey it is worth the splurge.l got this product for free from Topbox circle  in exchange for my honest review Packaging is luxurious; the texture is bouncy yet feels light on the skin. I appreciate that it is not very strongly scented. After a few days of use I feel my skin is smoother, softer and more supple. Will continue to use to see if I can prevent more wrinkles. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. A lot of product in container. Goes on very thick. It’s really scented, which could cause me problems in future. As a mom in my 30s, Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème SPF 25 has been a game-changer. It hydrates, firms, and gives my skin a radiant glow—while also protecting it with SPF. Feels luxurious, but absorbs quickly, and fits perfectly into my busy routine. Love that it does so much in one step! I’ve been using this product for around 2 weeks and it has become a staple in my skincare routine. It’s a lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I highly recommended. This product was given by Topbox Marketing for reviewing purposes. I have been using this product for the past two weeks and am pleased with the product. My face feels moisturized, without feeling oily. My skin feels firmer and hydrated. I also like that it’s pretty much scent free. Love that it has SPF for the summer months. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Ive been testing this moisturizer out for the last couple of weeks and it's great! It's a super rich thick formula which I love but someone with oily skin may find it too heavy. There is also a sent with this product. It's a light sunscreen sent which my skin doesn't seem to mind at all! I love the added bonus that theres SPF 25 in the moisturizer for days that I forget to put my sunscreen on. Overall a great product! A luxury moisturizer that instantly enhances & improves your appearance. The quailty and texture of the Estee Lauder revitalizing moisturizer is truly unmatched. While I have been using this product, my skin feels and looks like Ive been aging backwards. My skin is more even, pores have minimized, fine lines reduced next to nothing & my skin is tighter and so smooth. My skin no longer feels and looks dull. My skin looks youthfully radiant, healthy, & hydrated. The product absorbs smoothly, and feels so good on my skin. Because of the high quality ingredients a little goes a long way when applying it. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. The texture is rich but sinks in effortlessly, leaving my skin soft and refreshed. After a few days, I noticed a visible glow and firmness. It layers well under makeup and feels super nourishing.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I absolutely love Estee Lauder.  I normally wear their Resilience Multi-Effect Moisturizer Tri-Peptide Face and Neck Creme SPF 15, however I'm finding it a little heavy for Spring/Summer.  This REVITALIZING SUPREME+ SPF25 was a welcoming change as I've now tested it during the Summer when my skin isn't as dry and has a superior amount of added moisture to it (it's not heavy feeling but drenches and plumps your skin).  While it has a decent SPF amount, I still wear it under an SPF50 first (and let it soak in well first).  This also pairs nicely with their Perfectionist Pro Serum in which this does not pill after applied.  Again glad I tried it out as it's now my Spring/Summer go to for my moisturizer.  Sunscreen layers nicely on top and doesn't pill either.  I do not recommend this at night as it has SPF in it.  I still stick with my Resilience Multi-Effect Night cream on top of my Advanced Night Repair serum.  
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. WOW🤩 the texture of this cream is just A DREAM! Its thick but soft, can feel how protects my skin, leaving this light barrier. Hydrates so good, I’ve been using it everyday. ** I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. After using this moisturizer for a week, I'm very impressed! It has a rich creamy texture that hydrates so well without leaving my skin greasy! I use this as a day cream and night cream and the hydration and softness lasts all day! I love how radiant my skin looks after using this and my makeup applies beautiful on top of this. I'm rather picky when it comes to moisturizers and this is a winner! It gives my skin luminosity and a lifted look! Highly recommend! I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. ⭐ Rating: 5/5

I've been using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for a few weeks now, and my skin is obsessed. It’s rich but not heavy, melts in beautifully, and gives me that soft, bouncy feel with zero greasiness. The hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day, and I’ve noticed my skin looks smoother and more radiant—like I actually got 8 hours of sleep. Perfect under makeup, too. Total glow-up in a jar!

Would absolutely repurchase.✨ I received this from #topbox and Estee Lauder 
The cream is nice and creamy. My skin is so dehydrated that I need that extra moisture daily. I used it at night, and my face felt so soft. Let's hope in time the results are going to be noticed. I received this product for free from Topbox for review and testing purposes.
I absolutely love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft, smooth, and hydrated. Since I started using it, I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant. The hyaluronic acid delivers a great hydration boost without making my skin feel greasy. Highly recommend! I have received this product from Topbox, the cream is thick and slightly oily and also have fragrance. I have applied it during the night and day, as I have combination skin I felt it was oily and it will works better for me in winter than in summer. But I will continue to use in the night and I like the texture of the moisturizer. It would be good if the product does not have any fragrance. One this I like about the product is on applying, it gets absorbed into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave any white cast like the regular sunscreen. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I can't say much. However, I have really sensitive skin, and when I use it, no irritation or breakouts. Which is very important to me as I have crazy reactions to products I recieve this product for free from topbox for review and testing purpose.Love this moisturizer! It feels rich yet lightweight and leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and hydrated. I’ve noticed my skin looks more plump and radiant since using it. The hyaluronic acid gives a great hydration boost without feeling greasy. Definitely a new favorite! I can’t believe I’ve only just discovered this moisturizer. First of all, it has SPF 25, which is a huge bonus, especially for those quick moments I am out for a short period of time, when I forget sunscreen. Knowing my skin is protected even during those times is such a relief.
As a moisturizer, it’s absolutely divine. It glides on like silk, feels luxurious, and leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. The scent is subtle but lovely—clean and elegant, not overpowering.
Also, I worry about breakouts when trying new products and none at all for this. My skin has been loving this. I use it every morning, and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day without getting greasy.
I’m genuinely so happy with this purchase and already planning to restock once I run low. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new moisturizer.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. I have found my new staple. I love how it has spf along with a great moisturization.
I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. This product has a very soft baby touch like consistency. It smells like sunscreen and is in a very nice container. When I put it on my skin it blended into my skin very seamlessly it does seem to have a white cast when you blend it in but with a lot of blending it disappears right away! I received this for free from TopBox circle marketing. This moisturizer is a dream. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and looks noticeably firmer and more radiant. The texture is luxurious, absorbing beautifully without any greasiness. Plus the added SPF 25 is fantastic for daily protection. It's truly a powerhouse for youthful, healthy-looking skin.I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. If you have sensitive skin, this is not the product for you.  This creme had a strong fragrance and was very irritating to my skin.  After one use, I developed a severe puritic rash that was uncomfortable.  It took about 2 weeks to resolve after needing to use a typical steroid. i used my points for a sample and it broke my face out bad...thing is not much breaks my out so I was surprised Hydration and Results From the first use, my skin felt instantly hydrated and softer. Over a few weeks, I noticed a more plumped appearance and a slight reduction in fine lines. It’s deeply nourishing without clogging pores, making it a good choice for people with normal to dry skin. For those with very oily skin, it might feel a little too heavy. It’s a nice moisturizer, but frankly I’ve used better for less money. Not worth the money. It’s a thick cream in texture but I don’t find it very moisturizing. 
I’d stick with Clarins. I received this product in error from Sephora and am glad I did. I am 49 and my skin looks dehydrated after 2 hours of using anything. I put on my SPF, this moisturizer and then Tatcha Dewy Skin Mist and my skin (picture below) is plump and dewy 7 hours after application! I had a disappointing experience with this face cream. Unfortunately, I reacted poorly to it, resulting in significant swelling around my eyes and hives all over my face. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product. I received a sample of this and immediately bought a full size, amazing for mature skin- the scent is pleasant and does not bother me at all. I'm using the sample and already see results. will definitely buy full size. I just received it today and as a woman who suffers from migraines I cannot stand the perfume smell. It is suffocating. It’s not a natural “we’ve mixed all these wonderful ingredients to make your skin great” it’s a bottle of perfume in lotion form that will dry your skin because of it! This product did just nothing. Very overpriced. Smells really good but nothing more to say. Worst porches i ever had Every time I washed my face and using this I broke out Unfortunately this product irritated my skin. it's hit and miss when my skin reacts to products. after application within a couple hours, it started as a tingle and then started burning. Definitely not the product for me. I never write reviews but I got this in a holiday set back in Dec. I just finished using the product and had to repurchase. It’s now a staple. My skin has never felt so soft!! This came in the Advanced Night holiday set from Estee Lauder that was an INCREDIBLE value. I have tried this particular product several times now and it's just meh. Lackluster. I wouldn't recommend or purchase. Absolutely love the results of this product but the fragrance is a deal breaker. Why do they have to do that!! My face has never felt or looked better but even the slightest smell gives me a headache and you can smell it come out when you work out which ends up burning my eyes I've used this for year off and on. And will probably keep going back to it. lol It's one of the only creams that actually hydrate my super dry skin. My only gripe is the scent. Smells like old lady perfume, which I suppose is expected from an older brand like Estee Lauder. The only comparable face cream I have found is the Tacha Dewy Face Cream (Which smells soooo much better. Very light, refreshing scent.). So I flip-flop between the two. I had over 100 points I decided to try this moisturizer wow!!! Leaves my face like a baby !!! Now i see why the bigger size is expensive but its worth it leaves my skin so smooth love it!!! Been using since my 20’s so it’s been a little more than a decade. Clearly looks like I’m in my 20’s when I’m not. so I’m a loyal loyal user. Celebrity brands come and go, but this creamy delicious cream is a forever in my routine for the rest of my life. I’m obsessed ￼with this! I use it in the morning , it makes your skin so soft and buttery goes perfect under spf and drunk elephant bronze drops. My skin overall is much plumper and smooth. I got a sample of this moisturizer and I am in love. It feels so nice, smells nice and really moisturizes my skin. After using this product over the last week, I can say it’s definitely not for me. I got the mini size with my points so I’m glad I was able to trial it. I’ve got really clear skin and it broke me out. The smell is nice but I’m not a fan of scents in my skincare. It feels really nice and luxurious on my skin. I use the Sephora skincare which is clean and I absolutely love it, will be sticking with that. I love this cream. It is silky smooth and combined with my anti-aging serum of choice, this face cream is wonderful. I received this as a sample.  It was mid winter, my hands were red, chapped and splitting from what I've no clue.  I used this on them once and they were healed within the hour.  My face is way to sensitive for me to put anything on it, but this is fabulous if you have painful red winter hands. Perfect moisturizer for my sensitive, fair, dry skin, lasts all day, winter and summer. No dry patches. No reactions. The scent is subtle. Skin is visibly smoother, more plump and radiant. 5stars This is a great moisturizer but the biggest issues for me were the fragrance which lasts a while and that it’s irritating to my eyes especially if I sweat later in the day. I think Rose Ingleton’s moisturizer is a great frangance free alternative especially if you want a moisturizer with less fragrance I have dry, pigmented skin, and this has worked wonders. Literally gives me a filter effect. ￼ I got this as a complementary gift when I ordered mascara from Estée Lauder. It is over the top when it comes to fragrance. It goes on thick, but does not hydrate. Not a fan whatsoever. I use it on my legs now My combination skin love this stuff so far and gives a nice silky smooth feel. So far so good. I liked this moisturizer and it made my skin dewy and supple. However, it was a little too thick for me, especially during the summer months. Better for winter or very dry skin, probably. Overall very nice and smells good too!
I received this product complimentary in exchange for a fair review. Lovely cream that moisturizes and brightens my complexion! This moisturizer is a good option.  I received a free sample to test out and review from influenster. I am not sure of the long term impact but short term, I’ve had good results.  It’s a thicker formula so I found myself using a little more product but it’s a rich, hydrating formula. It is scented and isn’t my favorite scent (perfumed scent) but it does dissipate pretty quickly.  This works best when washed before each time you apply. I break out pretty easily but this didn’t break me out which is great. I loved the texture of this moisturizer. When applying it to my skin, I felt that it went on super smooth. Despite being a cream type, it absorbed completely into my skin without any greasiness. I have combination skin and this seemed to help with some of the dry patches that sometimes pop up from time to time. In addition, the scent was light and refreshing - a winning combination. Let me start by saying that I am not one to splurge on beauty products unless I hear AMAZING things about it. So let me just tell you that after testing a sample of this product for a couple of weeks, I am ready to splurge on the full size product!!

My skin is definitely showing signs of “maturing” at forty years old. I have tried a lot of products over the past few years, both high end and drug store (you know the drug store brand commercials…”better than the $100 cream”). Truth be told, none of the products I have tried for my maturing, combination skin, have blown me away. That is, until this little baby came along. It’s weightless, and makes your skin feel soooo smooth. I love that it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I am definitely noticing a decrease in fine lines.

If you are showing signs of aging skin, give this product a try! I received a small sample of Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I loved using this moisturizer! It's thick and luxurious and felt great on my oily skin. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this moisturizer. I used this mostly in the AM for a little over a week. It is lightly scented but that didn't bother me. I can't speak to the long-term benefits since I only used this for a short time but I would love to continue using this moisturizer! I love Estee Lauder, it works perfectly for my skin, I never had any problems or issues with this brand. The moisturizer is great, now that the air got soooo dry in Texas, I must have a good moisturizer. I apply it ok face and neck, in the morning and at night. The skin feels good, as it feels very dry after washing it. I received a sample of this in exchange for an honest review. It was too small to see the long term effects of the product, but I definitely noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin looked and felt. I tend to get very dry when the weather starts to get colder but this definitely helped keep that at bay. I thought the event was light and really nice, and I am usually sensitive to heavily scented products. I especially love that a refill pot is available to save on packaging waste. The packaging is lovely has has a luxe look to it as well. Love this! My skin gets very dry in cold weather and I noticed a huge difference with only 1 use. A little goes a long way and it’s definitely moisturizing. I received this from moisturizer for free from Estēe Lauder and Influenster. Unfortunately when I began to use it I broke out. It has a light fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly. It has a creamy texture that goes onto the skin beautifully. I would have to try it again to see if it continues to cause breakouts. I liked it so much that I used it completely in a week.  I liked how it left my face soft and hydrated.  It has a super soft texture that does not leave the skin greasy.  its aroma is also super light.  Too bad it was a very small sample.  but I am happy to have tried it for sure I will buy it later.  highly recommended.  I really liked the packaging, both the material and its color make it look very elegant. I was excited to try this item. It did not have a oily look or texture. It was easy to use and after a few days I felt that I could see a change with some of my face wrinkles. I loved this product, after using only few days i started to notice changes on my skin. It made my skin to feel firmer and started vanishing wrinkles. More glowing and younger look skin! Recommend it! This is a thick and heavy cream but it does absorb pretty quickly after applying. It does leave my skin feeling oily for longer than I would prefer. I have tried other Estee lauder moisturizers and this is not one I would repurchase because it did not work for my personal preferences. After using this product I did not notice a difference in my skins appearance. I found the cream to be a bit thick and not very hydrating. There are better products on the market. Received this as a trial from Influenster for an honest review.  So glad to have had the opportunity to try it too!This moisturizer was very good. I typically have normal skin but as the weather changes it tends to get drier in the cooler months. I find that this definitely helps keep my skin from feeling dry. It absorbs very well, has a light scent, non-greasy yet makes skin supple and hydrated.  I liked it very much and I think at this price point it’s worth it! I really love the way this makes my skin feel. I think it’s too soon to see any visible results which is why I only gave 4 stars but it definitely feels like it’s doing something and I’m excited about it. I received this complimentary to test and love it. It doesn’t have an oily feel at all and makes my skin feel very moisturized. I am not huge into scents but this one is light. I received a small sample of this cream from Influenster to review. I think the sample was a bit small to test it’s anti aging properties. However, so far I really like how it is feeling on my skin. Works wells with my combo skin - enough moisture for the stubborn dry parts. But not too much or clogging my more oily parts. I plan on purchasing a regular size one to truly test the anti aging claims. I got this complimentary from influenster and i love it. Only receieved a small sample jar but it definitely makes me wana buy full size. My skin is dry n gets worse when fall and winter hit, this made my face feel soft and hydrated. Anything with hyaluronic acid in it sign me up You definitely can feel the luxury from the packaging to the feeling of the thick and moisturizing cream. Worked really well under makeup for me. Unfortunately with the trial size I received I don’t think I had enough time to see long term benefits, but it definitely feels nice and moisturizing. Love love love it!! Made my skin look so amazing!! Some one asked if I had Botox!! Get it now! I don’t have any wrinkles or fine lines, so I can’t speak to how it works for those, but it is a great moisturizer. It isn’t heavy or sticky. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, kind of a basic “skin care” scent. I love this product it made my face feel so good and it is definitely a plus to put on before makeup your makeup looks so much better on your face I have combination skin, mostly dry throughout the day, especially in the morning. I have to use a skin moisturizer. I don’t use it everyday, but sometimes my skin is in need of a miracle, even my eyelids feel dry. After using the moisturizer it left my face looking very refreshed. My face felt hydrated and it didn’t have that tightness feeling that comes with dry skin. I also was complemented that I looked younger after apply this product to my face. Amazing but expensive. Left mt skin feeling healthy the times I had the chance to test it. My skin looked healthy and young and my makeup jus amazing.. 100% Recommended if you have the opportunity to put your hands on I thought this cream was great for my aging acne-prone skin. I use it in the winter and it never breaks me out. Next I will be trying the rich cream too see if I can get more moisture without acne. So age my skin is getting drier. I would totally recommend this cream! I thought this cream was so luxurious. I have repurchased several times. It is not irritating to my sometimes sensitive skin, and really keeps me moisturized. Has a pleasant light scent. I'm using Lancome product from 15 years. I like all wrinkle creams, serum,lipstick,makeup remover, toner and perfumes, and I love this new cream 300, now I'm going to get second jar. I already recommended my couple of friends and they bought it. Just switched to this from Absolut and definitely have a new favorite face cream My skin is much more softer than before. I wish I bought it a few years ago. I bought the R√âNERGIE H.P.N. 300-PEPTIDE CREAM last year and it was amazing. I will continue using it for years to come. Love this cream and great to find out there are refills.  Always feel better to not fill up the waste land with excess packaging. I love that this cream plumps and moisturizes my skin without the greasy feeling.  I have sensitive skin and this cream does not irritate or clog pores.  I have just finished my first jar and have ordered a refill! I like the texture of this cream and it's not greasy at all. It absorbs well into my skin. I also like how you can just buy the refill which is environmentally friendly l. Lovely texture but my skin had to get used to it with a few breakouts to start with. ( and I am 60) I avoid nose area and use sparingly and have good results. Love it This is a really nice cream. It has a great consistency. It isn't so great for me. It makes my face so shiny. I have oily skin to begin with, so that is definitely part of it. I love the night cream from this same line of products. This particular product is not for me, unfortunately. I love this profuct i like the my skin feels and looks my skin is soft smooth hydrated not greasy. Excellent product i cant say enough about this product. As soon as i run out i will buy again then again.  This product starts the off right when your getting ready! This is way to thick to wear during the day. It obliterated my make up and felt gross. I would agree with others that the smell is strong but it doesnt last long. The smell goes away fairly quickly. I would use it at night and my skin would be so soft in the morning. I did buy it on sale and if it went on sale again, i would purchase again. I use this instead of my usual moisturizer now. The Renergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Cream SPF 25 out performs alot of creams I have tried in the past. I highly recommend this cream to anyone. I have been using Lancome for many years now and very happy with this product. Been wearing this for a couple years, previously used Benefait Total. Goes on light amd smooth and makes it easy to wear sunscren. I love this product. It helps my skin stay hydrated and lifts it up. This has lasted me forever--because I hate using it. Smells and feels like sunscreen. Some people obviously love it for their skin, but for mine it looks and feels oily and never absorbs. I only use it when I'm out of everything else. It feels like wearing wasted potential. This is a great anti-aging moisturizer, i can see the results in a short period of time, leaves a natural glow not a greasy complexion. My opinion of this lotion is, that it's smells and feels nice on my skin I thought it helped with a wrinkle very quickly. I especially like that it has SPF in it. When it first came out, it didn't have that. I was going to wait until Lancôme made it with it. Excellent for a healthy and beautiful skin, no wrinkles in your face! I'm overall satisfied with the face cream. It moisturizes your skin and doesn't feel sticky at all. I love the feel of it and how it glides on smoothly without any noticeable residue. Also improved the look of my lines and wrinkles. Not worth the $$$. I find the Elemis marine cream does more than this one. I have been using for awhile & don't see any difference. I use along w/ the matching Lancome serum. Wonderful product I have been using this product since I received it (which has been 2 weeks) and so far it has not improved my wrinkles or dark spots. This product is simply ok, for women over 40. It's definitely not my the best for this age group.  The spirit is hard on the eyes. I have been able to see fine lines disappear my face feels softer and I feel great This cream was absolutely good it worked in so many different ways for my skin helped my complexion my texture of my face helped reduce lines made my skin look nice and firm just overall good Recieved a sample of this and its just reeks of perfume and its not a flattering type of smell, remind me of my grandma house. Its too thick and texture reminds me of ointment cream. I was so happy to have the chance to review this amazing sunscreen! At first it felt very thick, but that was just a small sensory issue. I love it very much and feel like it had benefitted me so much. I've been using this product for the past couple of weeks and I am impressed! It's smooth, it's thick but not greasy and no white cast. It's been a great addition to my skincare regimen. I usually use SPF and a light moisturizer but this is a combo day cream and it's so great! I really like the Lancome Renergie peptide cream with SPF 25 as it feels luxurious on my skin and has anti-aging benefits. It glides on smooth and feels light. It also has a very pleasant scent. You wear it under your makeup as the peptides help combat sagging and wrinkles. However, you can wear it alone due to the SPF.
I'm turning 56 and feel that it has improved my skin's texture. I have been using Lanome Renergie H.P.N. 300 Peptide cream for a couple of weeks now and I am so pleased. I use it in the morning after my ritual cleansing routine. It glides on easily and soaks into the skin beautifully. It has a very luxurious feel to it. Creamy and sumptious. I can already see a difference in my fine lines and some of my sun spots have faded as well. My skin has a dewy look to it. My husband even commented on my glowing skin! The spf 25 has helped on my daily walks. I highly recommend this Lancôme Renergie day cream and will purchase when I finish this one. Thank you Lancôme and BzzAgent for this opportunity to fall in love with my skin again. I love luxury skincare and I love more luxury skincare that actually works and this cream is pure delightful, every time that I applied it into my face. I really feel my skin hydrated and soft, smells delicious and has 25 spf. I used this product for a full 30 days and I didn't like the film left on my face. It took a few minutes to dry down and I don't feel like the moisture absorbed in my skin, but rather just lay on the top of my skin. I've used better moisturizers. Best daily moisturizer ever! Grateful sunscreen has been added so I may wear nothing on my face but it (and Génifique serum underneath)! I've just started using this cream about one week ago and I love it. I can see the difference My skin looks great, smooth and fresh. I used 3 jar already and love it so much,it makes my skin super soft all day long My friend recommended it to me and I am glad that I will give it the opportunity to try it. Once I try it, I will share my experience  through a review. Thank you! I like the Renergie H.P.N cream. My skin is much smoother and my dark spots are less visible. Blends well with my liquid foundation. My only wish was that it had higher SPF. Most likely I will buy it again. Nice and lightweight no sticky or greasy. Love that it has spf and a nice light scent. I've been using this every morning for a few weeks. I don't think it has reduced any wrinkles/lines but it is rich and my skin feels hydrated all day. My make up goes on nicely on top and stays on. I'm happy overall. Like the texture and feeling on my face. Great for spring & summer, not sure about winter yet. Nice product. I like the fact that it has sunscreen Rénergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Cream Spf 25 was so soothing and pampering to my thirsty skin. The subtle citrussy scent was pleasant and added to the experience. Lancome created another one that surpasses expectations. This cream made my face feel so soft and supple. It was a wonderful trial. I had tried this product without SPF and really loved it, this formulation with SPF is a completely different consistency and doesn't feel as moisturizing. 
 I also think this may be causing me to break out. I Love the cream but the price shot up to the point that you are not getting what yo pay for and the jar got smaller which is disappointing especially since I always buy the largest jar. Love this cream. I'm on my 60's but look younger than most 40 yrs old. I recently started using the Lancôme Rénergie H.P.N. 300 Peptide Cream, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. From the elegant packaging to the luxurious texture, this cream exudes quality. Upon application, it feels rich and hydrating without being greasy, which is perfect for my combination skin.

After a few weeks of consistent use, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's firmness and elasticity. Fine lines and wrinkles appeared less pronounced, giving my complexion a smoother, more youthful look. The peptides and other active ingredients seem to work wonders in revitalizing my skin. Additionally, I love the subtle, pleasant fragrance which adds to the overall experience without being overpowering.

Overall, the Lancôme Rénergie H.P.N. 300 Peptide Cream has become a staple in my skincare routine. It's a bit of an investment, but the noticeable results and luxurious feel make it worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their skincare regimen with a potent anti-aging product. I've just been using this product for 3 months and I love how it makes my skin feel & look I was asked to review this product.  I was already using Lancome moisturizer and I o Comparing Lancome to JLO's products... I thought they were similar, but Jlo has spf which pulled it ahead...until I received the 300 peptide cream, with spf 25. I've been using it almost daily and the results are great. I love having the spf built into the moisturizer This is light,and goes great under makeup. i have very sensitive skin,especially in regards to sunscreen,but did not react to this. This made my skin feel soft and rejuvenated! I love that it has SPF. I have extremely fair skin and I love having SPF infused into my products. Most products containing SPF really flare up my sensitive rosacea skin, but this DID NOT. It really does well on removing dry patches and provides smooth, vibrant skin after just a couple of uses. The packaging is beautiful providing a luxury experience. The only con is it does not absorb well enough and therefore my makeup does not last all day like it does with other fully absorbing moisturizers. It was a simple application. Due to my sensitive skin it worked out perfectly for me. Definitely good for the sun. After cleansing skin with a face wash pat skin dry. Apply in small dots to the face and massage in gently. When applying to eye area lightly tap in the skin under eye area softly with finger as this area is delicate. This is also a product that can be applied with a brush or jade roller and massaged in with a gua sha for added face sculpture and anti aging and wrinkles benefits. I Love it!!! This cream is excellent as a daily final cream. The new formula is excellent and SPF is great I have been using for about 3 weeks. I love the smoothness that it applies. With the peptides I can see my skin firming and looking refreshed and renewed. It also smells wonderful. The fact that it also has an spf high enough to add to my daytime routine means ones less product. I used this for almost 3 weeks and it has almost completely transformed my skin. It feels so soft and so much more youthful! You won't be disappointed! Next time I'm hoping we were given full time to test true 60-90 days for true potency. I like texture of the creme but I fear it's a bit too heavy for my combination sensitive skin. Lancome's Renergie day cream provides all day moisturizer with SPF. It is light and gentle on combination skin. However, I did not notice any significant improvement in my skin's texture and appearance. This was a a luxurious cream. It's packed with different peptides, plus spf was an added bonus. I definitely noticed a difference in my skin after 2 weeks. Lines were softer, skin was more plump and hydrated. My daughter complimented, my skin was looking nice. Definitely would use this product again! After using this product for 3 weeks I am in love! Application is silky smooth, it feels luxurious. I love that this peptide cream rubs in so nicely and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or tacky. It dries and can be flawlessly layered with makeup or other products. I have noticed such an improvement in the texture and redness on my face. My skin tone appears more even and feels plump and hydrated. The scent of this face cream is clean and light. I also appreciate that they offer a refill option to reduce plastic waste when it's time to repurchase. I was delighted to get the opportunity to review & try this product!  SPF25 plus all of the things a girl in her 50's needs in a moisturizer, pleasant smell (barely any scent at all), non-greasy, make-up goes on smoothly over it.  I have been using this for several weeks, noticing a decrease in fine lines, smoothing my skin overall & those darned dark spots from sunworshiping are fading & looking lighter.  I love the idea of  a product that will reduce lower face sagging bc that seems to be a trouble spot & where things start (no pun intended) start going south after 50.  I don't need much to cover my face & neck area which means that it will last quite a while.  I look forward to seeing more results with longer use.  Will I purchase it?  Yes I will & I will tell all of my friends bc this stuff is fabulous!!! I love this product! Long lasting, all day wear. Smooth and creamy, not greasy. After using for awhile can tell a noticeable difference  and improvement in my skin. I received this free product from BzzAgent and Lancôme in exchange for my honest review. 
This cream hydrates and moisturizes my skin. It leaves my skin glowy and ready to apply makeup. I noticed my fine lines and my large pores are less noticeable after few weeks. It has a subtle scent. I'm very satisfied with this product since it's very gentle with my sensitive skin. This cream is a great addition to my skincare routine. I love that It has SPF so I can use during the day to protect my skin. It leaves my skin feeling plumped and juicy. My skin feels much more smoother and youthful. I would never have believed this change in product could make such a difference in my skin. This cream has given my face a softness that feels delicious and a glow that I haven't  had before. This is my new favorite product. When I used this product the first few days, I was instantly floored! I felt like my skin was brighter and dewy, the added benefits of peptides and SPF is also a huge plus. Initially I really loved the idea of this product because of my curiosity of starting to use peptides in my skincare routine. I was excited to be sent this product and to also finally give the Lancome skincare line a try. This cream is a little thicker than I am used to for a day cream in the Spring/Summer but the texture was smooth, a little greasy, and the scent is pleasant. After about a couple of weeks, I noticed my pores were a bit clogged with whiteheads and I had a couple of breakouts. Now I will say, the warm weather is probably not suited for this type of day cream on my combination skin so I can see this cream being way better for me in the cooler, dryer Fall/Winter seasons and will wait to give it a full re-try again then. I still think this is a great day cream to try if you are looking for something with SPF and has the added anti-aging benefits. I was very excited to receive the Renergie H.P.N. 300 peptide cream spf 25.  Heading into summer I especially look for products with SPF. I have been using this product for a few weeks and love the fresh clean smell and love how it absorbs into my skin.  My stays hydrated and is visibly firmer. Pleasantly scented with just the slightest floral scent this moisturizer with added spf protects your skin against sun. It is creamy and rich and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and smooth. It's easily applied and quickly absorbed into your skin not leaving it looking greasy. It also didn't look cakey or pilly under my makeup. A must add to any skin routine. I was excited to know that I could try this cream since it is from an accessible luxury brand, and as soon as it arrived I wanted to try it. The consistency is soft and very light, it doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all but when I smelled it I realized that I couldn't use it since my skin is sensitive and although the aroma is light I wanted to give it a try and with the first use I could feel that uncomfortable and itchy. So I knew it wouldn't be for me. Luxurious box design. After a few weeks of use, the skin has changed, the skin is brighter, smoother, and brown spots have improved Rénergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Cream Spf 2 is thick and creamy but absorbs very well into my skin. This cream worked well at reducing my dark spots and protecting my skin against aging. I like that the 300 peptides stimulates faster and enhanced skin renewal. I have used this Lancome peptide face cream with spf for the past few weeks and I am really enjoying it. It is very hydrating and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin with the chemical spf like other products do. I also find my makeup layers well on top of it which for me is a tell of a great moisturizer. In love with Lancôme Rénergie HPN 300-Peptide Cream with SPF 25 💖 It's about to become my go-to summer moisturizer- hydrating, healing, anti-aging and sunscreen. Nothing short of fantastic, IMO 🧖🏼‍♀️ I'm trying a different product to substitute for Renergie Anti-aging moisturizer which is out of stock. I have used Renergie for many, many years. It's my favorite!! This new product is good so far. Disclosure: I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.
I am located in a fairly humid area and was concerned this may be too thin for me, but it was perfect! It absorbed in the skin quickly and was a really thin in consistency, After about two weeks of using I noticed changes in my skin. It looked much more plump than prior to using. I noticed a lot of difference in the overall appearance of my skin as well as some fine lines appearing much fuller. Did not notice a white cast with the SPF in the product and as an almost daily make-up wearer, I was able to apply make-up over it just fine with my regular skincare routine. I like the feel of this moisturizer.  It absorbs fairly quickly and I like the idea that the SPF 25 protects my skin on a day-to-day basis. I really like this Lancôme Renergie HPN 300 Peptide SPF 25. It applies nicely and absorbs quickly and easily. No white cast at all. I just don't love the scent of it. It's heavily floral scented and I just don't like any skin products to be scented. For it to be that scented and be right on my face is very unpleasant for me. If it wasn't for the scent I feel I would love this SPF. I would recommend it to people who don't mind floral scented products. I love what a great multitasker this product is! I noticed after a few days of using this product that my skin felt very hydrated and so soft. I have also noticed the softening of some of my fine lines. The formula is non-greasy, has a pleasant smell and the added bonus of spf-something I feel every moisturizer should have. I decided to try the version with SPF instead of the regular Renergie HPN peptide cream, which I really love The consistency isn't nice like the original version and it has made me break out terribly.  I'll be switching back to the non SPF version, pity I bought the huge bottle of the SPF version :( I've been using this product for a few weeks now. It's very lightweight and is easy to apply. It's a thin facial cream and smells good, too. It's working well so far, leaves my skin a little red after application. This cream is nice, though I think I would like it more without the SPF. You get that SPF ""feel"" after a while. It's not a heavy feeling, but it feels more noticeable than a moisturizer without SPF. Generally, it is nice to have the added SPF in such a nice cream for convenience. I will continue to use it. This is a great day cream and last step to any daytime skincare routine. It hydrates in the best way while giving a dewy finish and not your typical greasy SPF residue leaving cream that many SPF creams on the market, in my opinion, leave my skin feeling. I live in Florida so a SPF cream is required and in the past I have left that step out because I am prone to break outs and clogged pores. This is the best of both worlds and does not leave the skin feeling yucky while still protecting from harmful UV rays. I have been using the product every night and enjoy the luxurious texture and has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles! The one downside which is why I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the use of fragrance. In a high-end produce like this I would expect it to be fragrance free. I have sensitive skin so tend to avoid things with fragrance in them. I used this cream every morning. 

It made a great sunscreen! I was outside a lot and NEVER got sunburned on my face.

It also appeared to have softened some of the wrinkles on my forehead. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and did not have any burning or redness with use. 

I did not notice a reduction in dark spots or that it firmed my skin at all.

The only issue I had was if I got sweaty working outside, the cream did burn my eyes.

I received the product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I absolutely LOVED this product!! I searched, and couldn't find anything I didn't love. From the packaging to performance this product is LUXURY! Its lightweight formula packed a heavyweight punch with productivity. My skin was brighter, firmer, healthier, and moisturized without getting oily. I would highly recommend this and won't hesitate to buy the entire product line. I loved it and you will too! I received this product a few weeks ago to try out and review. Since using this, my dark spots have improved, starting to see them fading. Makes my skin feel hydrated, but not greasy, like some SPC creams. No white cast. Dries down nicely and my makeup applies very smoothly over it. Works well with various primers too. Hoping to see some improvement on my forehead lines, time will tell. If you are looking for a day cream, and are not sensitive to fragrance, I highly recommend this!! Bonus is that it's refillable, and the refills are cheaper. I use the cream every morning and night and I love the way it makes my skin Look and Overall Brighter Skin and makes it real soft Absolutely love the texture of this product and how it just melts into the skin. Have been seeing amazing results as well! Lancome Rénergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Cream Spf 25 is thick, rich, and creamy.  It leaves my face feeling soft and nourished.  Even my husband mentioned that my skin has a glow to it and was softer.  Honestly, I was stunned he noticed, which definitely states how well this cream has been working for me.
With a SPF of 25, it also helps protect my face from sun damage.  The sun and I are not friends.
It has a pleasant, slightly floral scent.
Ther packaging is attractive and it would make a lovely gift. I like this product! There's not really a scent and it's feels very rich to the touch. I do wish it had a higher SPF and it wasn't expensive. Would I purchase again maybe because of the price range however I recommend it to family and friends. I've always had a love/hate relationship with day creams that contain SPF. Although I completely understand the importance of SPF, I'm not sure if it's the scent, white cast or greasiness I associate with sunscreens but I'm pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers with added SPF. I've tried many and this Rénergie H.P.N. 300-Peptide Anti-Aging Cream SPF 25 from Lancôme is definitely one of the best. It's very hydrating without feeling too heavy. My face tends to sweat ALOT and it doesn't feel like it just sits on the surface of my skin and roll off throughout the day. It makes my skin feel plump & smooth when I use it consistently and it leaves my skin looking radiant & healthy! As usual there's just something special to me about Lancôme products, I've been using them since I was very young…I would sneak through my moms products growing up (which were mainly all Lancôme) and use everything I could find lol!! (sorry mom LOL)
Plus the packaging is gorgeous!! I'm proud to display this jar on my dresser! I love that this has spf but I just wish the amount of spf was higher. It's a very lightweight cream and has a nice floral scent to it. I personally tend to shy away from fragrance but this wasn't too bad. It's a very hydrating cream. My only complaint is the amount of spf. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Here we go. I googled this product and it's pricey. So not worth it.
First...the smell: it's overwhelming and obnoxious. It smells like something from Avon circa 1954 that has gone bad in the back of great aunt Marge's vanity and was found last year after she died. This is a PRESTIGE brand; why does it smell like something the coroner would use too cover decomp? 
Second: I have no idea if it is the perfume or the chemicals, but my eyes BURNED...they watered like someone had thrown chemicals directly into my eyes. I am not a particularly sensitive person. Either to scents or ingredients. But this was awful.
I tried applying to the back of my hand and gently spreading to let the product ""dry down"" slightly. Nope. It was just as bad. Just having it on the back of my hands made my eyes water. 
I can't imagine how bad it would be if you actually had allergies to these products. I received this SPF day cream and I was very excited to try this cream.  I used it every morning for a few weeks to get the full effects of the cream and I gotta say that this felt amazing on my skin!  I loved that it was on the thicker, creamier side as a day cream but also included SPF 25.   My skin felt firmer and more hydrated after having used it for a few weeks.  I also love the smell of the cream which has a subtle rose smell. Ever since I started using this, I no longer use the separate SPF that I was using daily before because this has enough for me. I appreciate that this goes on my face smoothly and has an amazing scent. I am also able to apply my make up on top of this without having to worry about it looking caked up or not mixing well when I  apply any powder, I can easily apply more if I need to during the day and not worry about messing up my make up. I highly recommend this and have been using this every day and love the way my skin stays soft! This is a luxurious feeling, thick cream. The SPF25 is a nice addition to a daily face cream. I have been using this peptide cream for a little over two weeks now and I have seen improvement in my melasma spots. I've also noticed my skin is more glowy. This cream is definitely pricey but for the visible results, I think it's worth it. I received this anti-aging cream to try and I fell in love with it. I use Lancome Renergie night cream already so I knew how amazing this brand is. I tried this in tandem with the night cream for a few weeks and I can honestly say I noticed a difference in how smooth my face felt, it not only feels supple but you can see a difference in the lines they are not as pronounced. The fact that this has SPF to help protect my face from further sun damage is a major win. I had my night cream but now I have my day cream as well. The formula is nongreasy, their is a slight scent but it's not perfumey at all. It works well with my foundation. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to protect their skin and reap the benefits of ant-aging skincare. The container holds alot of product and you don't need alot it spreads well and melts into the skin. Im 34 years old and I actually used this along with sending my 62 year old mother enough to sample it herself. I have extremely dry skin and seen a noticeable difference in the hydration of my skin. I'm also fair complected with auburn hair which the SPF is a massive benefit towards the protection of my skin. My mother also has fair skin, red hair, and has tons of beauty marks & freckles. She loved using this cream on her combination skin and being someone who's dealt with skin cancer in the past she told me this Lancome cream with SPF is one of her daily go to skincares. A little bit goes a long way, amazing product to have. I can definitely see some improvement. It's by far the best product I have tried. My skin feels smooth and rejuvenated. Loved this. Not oily, smells very light floral nothing too heavy. Don't feel tacky on skin. Dries down. I really love how this made my skin feel. Definitely something I will be adding into my skin care routine. Absolutely love this product, the SPF 25 sunscreen has worked perfectly to keep my skin from getting sunburnt on these beautiful days out. Not only that my skin feels more toned and youthful. Also my complexion looks flawless. And it smells lovely and the cream is just so rich. It works well without leaving a weird residue, pilling or making my face too oily. Has kept me from getting sunburnt. Keeps skin moisturized throughout the day with no breakouts I adore the smell of this cream, and the bottle it is in is beautiful. It's a great.consistency as well!

I do wish it was higher than 25SPF though because I need to put on another product for sun protection",4.314285714285714,210
Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation,"Nice product if you are looking for very light coverage.I got it on sale and will keep using it, but I wouldn't pay full price. I prefer the Chanel foundations. I love this foundation so much. I have combo skin (oily around nose, normal-dry on other areas) and it works beautifully on my entire face. It doesn’t crease, oxidize, or separate on me which some foundations do. The coverage is medium but buildable. I wish it ran a little paler but otherwise it’s a very beautiful  foundation Amazing light weight coverage. Not as transfer proof as I prefer but the job gets done. Beautiful semi matte finish. Makeup looks the same 12 hours later or more! No complaints will be in my top 3 This is my holy grail product. I’ve tried many other foundations but this is the only one that works for me. The lightness of the formula plus the coverage it provides is perfect. I paid a full price for two expired foundations so disappointing 🙄 This color has been great for me in winter months! Goes on smoothly and doesn’t feel heavy. I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback, and I can say I would purchase this again! Coming in hot to write a good review that isn't sponsored. I really love this foundation, I'm cool leaning neutral and 220C is perfect for me. It covers up my acne scars but still looks so natural and pretty. Picture isn't filtered, the coverage is great. I also have super oily skin and although it doesn't keep me completely matte all day, it's still nothing to complain about. My skin produces oil like Italy is running low. Doesn't crease into any fine lines, I'm surprised that I like it because most of the time I feel like foundations are wearing me and not the other way around. This allows me to feel like myself just better and less red This concealer is great! It goes on smooth, blends easily, and feels super lightweight on the skin. The coverage is buildable without looking cakey and sets to a beautiful matte finish that lasts all day. 
I love that it has no scent, and the packaging is sleek and minimal This product defintely goes on smooth and it last the entire day... just what i was looking for. i got question about this products i just buy this products since 2025 march or something but why it exp july 2024 ? can you explain I miss the shade 495N. It was my perfect shade in this product. I’m also not the biggest fan of the new formula but it gets the job done I started using this in 2023 and changed to a different brand in February 2024, I forgot why since my makeup looked good in a lot of photos, so i repurchased it recently,worst mistake! Right off the bat after ONE day of using it again, my skin immediately breaks out horribly. This was the only new product in my routine. I thought maybe it was just stress hormones or acne, but after the 4th day i stopped immediately as it just kept getting worse and worse.  A week later, my skin was 90% clear!  Also, throughout the 4 days i realized my makeup was very patchy and cracked after a couple of hours and VERY noticeable in person! i hydrated my skin a lot thinking it would solve the issue, but it still kept creasing. Lastly, it oxidizes almost immediately. If it didn’t oxidize as soon it made contact with skin, then it 1000% will after setting powder. i changed setting powders, moisturizer, techniques but all these issues were consistent. Sadly, i threw out the packaging of the foundation so now it’s just collecting disht lol. The main take away is if you’re into oxidized, cracked, creased makeup with a side of extreme acne then this is the foundation for yo! :) Great product received for review but its on of the best ive ever tried. I use it for my lace also 1. New formula made my entire face burn and peel for over a week.
2. Sephora wouldn't accept my return, NOT EVEN for a store credit, 33 days after I purchased it (post face peeling, when I felt OK to be in public again)
3. I reached out to Lancome on their website about the allergy, I have used this for years and just had this problem with the new formula, they never got back to me Bought this foundation online & I don’t shop often with Sephora but this will be my last time. This foundation separated on me & the color was ehhh. Tried to return it in store for a refund or exchange & denied cause they changed their policy to 30 days. I was 9 days outside of that policy.  refused to do anything. So Sephora won’t get my money no more. sticks to eyelid which causes eyelid to feel heavy and sticky. I have been using this foundation for years I recently bought a new bottle and noticed my skin looks very oily after wearing this. I looked this up and there is a new formula. Please bring the old formula back it was perfect Terrible experience! I can’t believe Sephora sold me the expired product. It expired in 06/25.
Please watch out for expiration date.
I am going to store soon to make them aware of this  fraud fraud.fr One of my favourite matte foundations feels so lightweight but has amazing coverage! I love how blurring this is and also how much it last through out the day without looking cakey My rating is actually 3.5. It's not bad but not that amazing either. Finish and coverage is okay. Longevity is also alright...but I'm not loving it. Likely related to the oxidization at times. Sometimes it looks fine and other times it looks darker than my neck. For the price, it doesn't seem worth it so in the end, I exchanged it for Dior Forever Skin glow (same price) and that was worth it ❤️ Why would they change the formula?? :( This was the only foundation I could use that looked great and didn’t break me out! I noticed after trying the new formula that I have clogged pores and new pimples forming. Checked the ingredients and sure enough, they added moringa Oliver seed extract. Highly pore clogging! This is my absolute favorite foundation. I’ve been using it for 5 years now and it’s the only foundation that doesn’t make me breakout. It’s full coverage and it applies perfectly to my skin. Beautiful matte finish but it isn’t heavy on the skin, very good excellent [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This foundation feels so good on my skin. I put it on after allowing my moisturizer to dry and I was so surprised how well it blended into my skin since I never have good results with foundation matching. But Lancome said we got you! They have a diverse range of shades and coverage to match my darker skin. This gave me such smooth effortless coverage, I didn’t need any blending, any powder, any blush – nothing else. I put this foundation on in the morning and wear it all day, it stays looking effortless all day. It has a light scent that fades once it dries and the product dries quickly. I also love that sunscreen is also right in the product, so I don’t have to apply a separate sunscreen before applying foundation and then risking my skin feeling oily or sweaty in the Southern heat. Best of all, this foundation is well-suited to all day wear, it minimizes my pores and causes no irritation. Even though I wore this foundation on days when it has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the product has not sweated off. I have even accidentally fallen asleep with it on and had to get up and wash it off in the middle of the night, and still my skin was smooth and breakout free. I’ve had this product for over two years! I repurchase anytime I’m running low because this is the perfect shade match, it’s full coverage and it’s a soft matte finish that looks like your skin! Ugh! Lancôme, DIVA!! Y’all ate this product down! This had a very smooth application and helped my fixed my dark marks. I was gifted this product and I apply as my concealer and underneath my makeup. It was terrible, Sephora sent me expired products.  
I never thought they would sell spoiled items.  
Girls, pay attention to the expiration date. I received this product to review. I liked the coverage but my skin did not like the product. It made me have a reaction. It may not affect you so give a try. This is my go to with full coverage foundation. Although it still oxidizes a little, it is a lot less than other foundations I've tried. Long lasting even when going to the happiest place on earth. Very nice. Smooth, thorough coverage but natural, not too matte. I was suffering fr perioral dermatitis when I started using it (plus sulphur cream) & now
The PD is gone! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Thank you Influenster and lancome for sending this foundation for free to review.  Lancome makes great make up for dry skin. The teinte idole performed well all day on my skin.  I need a different shade but was glad to test this product. Wish i had returned this right when i bought it. Not full coverage, its drying on the skin, and creates lines. I’ve been mixing it now with my other concealer/foundation just to use it up so its not a waste. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This had a great smooth texture and felt great on the skin. Once it was on for a bit I didn’t notice any transferring to clothes which is great! This color was slightly dark on me so I’ll probably need to wear during the summer. The packaging was really lovely! The pump worked great, too. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have enjoyed this foundations wide variety of shades to better match your skin tone. It has a pleasant scent. The coverage lasts for an entire day with a nice matte finish. Every time I try to explore other foundations I always come back to this girly. Full coverage but not cakey, never feels heavy, feels like skin looks like skin and last all day. Thank you Lancôme 💕 [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have enjoyed this foundations wide variety of shades to better match your skin tone. It has a pleasant scent. The coverage lasts for an entire day with a nice matte finish. I was excited to try out this new foundation but the foundation came expired. This used to be my absolute favorite foundation. Unfortunately, the new bottle revealed that they’ve changed both the formula and the shades. Really disappointing [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The bottle is a nice frosted glass and very heavy. The scent is a bit strong but it fades after a bit. The fountain oxidized a little after it was applied but not too much. It is more on the matte side but the coverage was stunning. Love this foundation! The photo is me after a fresh application. Zero coverage, I was so sad that wasted $50+ dollars on this. The coverage is awful. All my flaws showed right through. It dries down awfully fast which might be good for some people but I use a cream blush so it’s hard to work with for me. If you have acne scars or more reddish pink skin don’t use this foundation it covers nothing! 
Th Hands down the best foundation Ive ever owned. I try to find cheaper alternatives and can never seem to let go. Perfect for combo/oily skin. Its almost as if the foundation  uses your natural oil for that healthy skin look. I used to religiously swear by Teint Idole. It was essentially my holy grail foundation. Very full coverage without being too cakey. So naturally, when I saw this new formulation, I figured it was an improvement. I was incredibly wrong.
As soon as you apply it to your hand to put it on your brush, you notice how loose it is. Almost immediately after applying it to my skin, it had started to oxidize and look patchy near my hairline. It was settled so much into the lines on my forehead, I swear I look better without makeup. 
I actually reached out to Sephora to ask for an exchange or store credit as I'm so disappointed in this product, and despite being a Rouge, they sent me to Lancome to complain. Currently using this. And it’s either a hit or miss. It says it’s full coverage. But it’s more medium coverage and it’s not very buildable. But it’s better than a lot of products out there I was finally able to try this product.  I have oily combination skin and was worried that this foundation would breakdown after a normal day.  It worked beautifully - blended well and didn't oxidize. I used my normal primer and setting spray and was highly impressed.  After trying so many matte formulas, I have found it! I will actually repurchase this foundation! Best foundation ever! It feels lightweight but covers so much and looks like skin! I wish they did a mini bottle though so I wouldn’t have to waste so much product This foundation was awful for me. No staying power, yellowy undertone (had it matched at the store), patchy by the end of the day. I looked terrible for an important meeting. What a waste of money. This foundation is chef’s kiss! Feels super lightweight, blends like a dream, and lasts all day without drying me out. Love that it gives a soft matte finish but still looks like real skin. Definitely my new go-to! I love love love this foundation. It is super long lasting and it sits very nicely on the skin. It has a skin like matte finish so it still works on drier skin. I have this foundation in my Pro MUA kit and it has never failed me whenever I have used it. The shades run a bit pink. This foundation is actually chefs kiss. I LOVE IT. I have no idea why i stopped using this. It was my HG for almost a decade probably, i’ve been trying everything new lately but i just repurchased and i really took her for granted 😭 the best foundation for my oily/acne prone skin. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Shade ranges are large- you’ll find your shade and fast! Finish is good coverage and the packaging is beautiful. I love the glass container and I love how much you get for your buck! Try this out, you’ll like it! 
@Influesnster @lancome I didn’t want to like the product given the price, but it’s worth the money. Best foundation I’ve ever used. Good tone and good texture. Builds easily [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I was very unhappy with this product. Packaging and display of product were fine. But the coverage was very lose and almost oily. After putting on this product I noticed it was the wrong color and almost made my skin orange. Can’t say I would ever purchase this product again. Blends in nicely 
Stays on all day with no transfer 
I think my sensitive skin likes it too 
I wish it was a little cheaper though My 40+ dry skin is loving this foundation! Wish I discovered it sooner. I’ve been using Estée Lauder double wear forever and I still love it for full coverage days, but this one has a prettier finish while still providing coverage. Love it. I have been using this for about a year and a half now and I can say with the confidence that this is the best foundation that I’ve ever used! This foundation is full coverage matte finish. I was unable to find  a shade to match my skin tone because I have an olive under tone that this product does cater to. I have combination oily and dry skin, I felt like the product caked up over my oily areas and was easily wiped off. There was some creasing after extended wear. The pro of this foundation is that its ingredients include hyaluronic acid and vitamin E suitable for someone looking for hydration and coverage. Overall I think there are better cheaper options for my skin type/color. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review]I was sent the darkest shade possible while being as pale as a tissue. I couldn't use it but did test on my hand/arm for finish etcThis is amazing. The coverage is perfect and fill.the finish is supple and beautiful.ot didn't have a strong scent at all which I appreciate. The packaging is nice and quality.and the shade range is great. Excellent base in terms of its coverage and texture, it does not leave marks or part, I actually loved it and it lasts the whole day. The tone was a little dark, but I'm still enjoying it a lot. It's easy to work with and blend. meh, I would not purchase again. no hydration at all. but not matte either? did not sink into pores, but also did not blurr either? no coverage at all. more like a light to medium coverage? did not cover dark spots, acne, or any texture. actually highlighted texture if anything. clings to dry patches. settled into fine lines. didn't matter what primer I used, or if applied with a beauty blender or brush. shade was on point and didn't oxidize. I'll stick to dior. I have been using Estée Lauder
For a few years and I wanted to try something new, and this product is it ! So far so good, let’s see how it does in the summer. Oh and their shades are perfect!! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is truly a great foundation! One of the standout features for me is how weightless it feels on the skin, it’s like wearing nothing, but with great medium to full build able coverage. The semi-matte finish is beautiful and looks so natural and smooth. 

I have oily skin so I wore it with the Hourglass Veil primer and was impressed with how well it held up throughout the day. Even when my natural oils started to come through in the evening, it didn’t look greasy at all. Instead, it gave my skin a subtle dewy glow that looked fresh rather than shiny.

The only downside I noticed is with the shade range or the accuracy of the shades. When I first received it, I thought the color would be way too dark 345N , but it turned out to be a perfect summer match. Typically I would have picked a color in the 200N range considering I fall in the light skin tone range. To be honest, even for a summer shade I would have never gotten 345N which is for medium skin tone, assuming it would be far too dark. Usually for my summer shade I get a light medium shade. If I had picked it out myself based on what I usually go for, I probably would’ve ended up with something way too light. So definitely try it in person if you can. All in all, I absolutely love this foundation and will be purchasing it myself once I finish this bottle. Although it is full coverage, it clings to dry patches and almost curls up from the skin even with lots of eye prep. I’d recommend it for someone with more oily skin than dry for sure even though it’s a fan favorite, it sadly just didn’t work out for me (being a person with really dry under eyes) I thought Estée Lauder was the top tier unbeatable foundation, & while it was… it doesn’t compete with Lancôme w/ a full face beat. I adore this foundation so much, face has an extra umph to it when I’m wearing it [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a surprisingly lovely foundation. I loved the finish on my skin. I would describe it as a medium coverage foundation. I liked that the packaging allowed me to do partial pumps so that I could build up to my desired coverage. I didn’t really notice any scent to this product at all. Foundation doesn’t last long when you have oily skin. It says you have to reapply every 2 hours. Not worth the money. To me this is more of a foundation if you’re going to the beach and want to be applying it is spf. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product was amazing. Felt very light in my skin not cakey, went on very easy, not strong odor, perfect coverage, great selection of shades. Will purchase in the near future. Love how easily this foundation is to apply and to build to a light or higher coverage. I have combination skin. My skin felt balanced and the product did not crease or look greasy. My makeup held well for hours long after I applied it. The coverage was uniform and natural. Excellent finish, easy to blend, texture is smooth, buildable coverage, good shade range.  Packaging is sleek and the Lancôme brand has always been one to rely on. This was my first Lancome foundation product so I was super excited to receive. The color was slightly lighter than I needed, but i was able to work with it. The packaging was nice, as you would expect with a prestige foundation. The texture was thinner than most foundations I've used, but felt nice going on. The longevity was good, but I felt it looked better in the beginning than after a full day of wear. I've used many foundations so I wouldn't probably purchase this one when other lesser priced formulas perform as good or better. This reformulation is a joke. I went to rebuy 90N and it is literally the same color as my old 110C! I thought I grabbed the wrong bottle but NOPE, this ""new"" shade is way darker than it used to be. Shame on Lancome for not offering truly fair shades anymore. It also seems a little thinner even with shaking and not quite the same coverage level, maybe medium. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice formula with nice coverage. The packaging was nice. I like that it has SPF, it lasted several hours with primer and finishing spray. My biggest complaint was that the color looked orange. This was very disappointing as it was labeled as a cool toned shade. (I received this product free for my honest review). I love how smooth my skin look after I apply the foundation, the fact that im wearing make up but also protecting my skin is a win win, the satine finish is so nice I wear it everyday because you can build it up if you want too but also as a tint with very little amount you cover all the Imperfections This product has great coverage that not only feels light but stays all day. Perfect color match and smells great. Easy to use pump as well that keeps it fresh. This product came with a tab over it with an expiration that didn’t expire until next year. It looked like it was put on so I removed it and the real one underneath showed that it was expired. This is concerning to fake expiration dates. Especially because this product has sunscreen in it. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear melts into your skin flawlessly leaving a natural air brush finish without looking overly made up. It covers completely  without settling into fine lines and wrinkles [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Absolutely love this foundation. The shade I received was a touch darker than I usually wear which was perfect for vacation after I got a tan. The pump delivers just the right amount and I apply it with a beauty blender for lighter coverage. I appreciate that there is no fragrance. I used to be very loyal to this OG foundation. I have dry skin and found this to be too drying for me and it settles into my fine lines. I opted for a skin tint instead which works much better for me. ￼ This Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation is a foundation that delivers on its promises of long-lasting wear, buildable coverage, and a natural-matte finish. Its skincare benefits and shade further enhance my skin making far exceed my expectations it a high-quality foundation. the scent is pleasant &bthe packaging is definitely high-end! The packaging is extremely durable. It fell off a sink and nothing happened to it at all. The product itself isn't my favorite; it's too light. The coverage is 3/10, and I feel like it doesn't last long. In less than 4 hours, the blush color disappears along with the ink. It improves skin tone, but the effect doesn't last long. The color range is quite wide, but the price is quite high. Not sure why anyone wants to look dry and cakey, buildable means texture [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I didn’t like this product! It gets my skin really dry, the coloring is too heavy for me. I tried adding enough moisturizer but the result was the same! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.  This foundation offered great coverage!  My skin is fair and the shade I chose (220C) was a perfect match.  This product provides SPF 25 with its application and did not clog up my pores.  I finished this look with a light powder to set and forget.  All in all, easy to use and long lasting! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This foundation has already become a classic in my makeup, enhanced with hyaluronic acid, prebiotics, and vitamin E. Several products in one, while you look beautiful with your makeup applied, you're also taking care of your skin.
This foundation is moisture-resistant, perfect for warm summer days. I have combination skin, and every summer I appreciate it because my makeup looks beautiful and matte without the need for other products. I've applied it at the beginning of my day (6 a.m.) and it's 9 p.m., and I still look great. I highly recommend it with a balanced purchase. I want to leave a review for the Lancôme foundation I recently used and say that it’s the best foundation I’ve tried so far. Unfortunately,  the shade wasn't a match for me,  BUT i will be purchasing in my shade. That's how great it felt and looked when I swatched it! The bottle is sleek, and i love that's it's fragrance free! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love this makeup. It’s lightweight and buildable. I uploaded two different photos to show before and after. My skin isn’t the best but you can clearly see the difference with one application! There doesn’t seem to be a smell and a little goes a long way. The shade I picked was pretty spot on in my opinion. (I’m never good with picking a shade). Overall I’m very impressed with this product! I’m definitely going to continue using this! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The packaging is gorgeous on display. I dont notice a scent. The shade range is wide. The coverage is full. The finish is natural lending it's flexibility to be worn with creams or powders. Extremely lightweight. If you prep your skin nicely, you have a flawless finish all day long. It was nice during the cold weather but I feel like for my oily skin, it’ll be amazing during summer. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The packaging is gorgeous and the  coverage is fantastic,. The finish is beautiful, and the shade range is decent. I also wasn’t bothered by the scent as it wasn’t noticeable. It wears for long periods, covers all blemishes without looking or feeling heavy. I had to put on two coats to get the finish I wanted and it was soooooo pretty….. but after about 3 hours it started separating. I’ve been trying to find a foundation that can outer perform double wear and unfortunately this isn’t it. I feel that foundations are good but they have skin care in them, and that meshes with the skin prep. finally a foundation that passes the pore clogger and feels great for dry skin!  light- medium coverage and buildable.  my skin really likes this. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I was very excited about this foundation, and she is beautiful. Packaging was nice and simple. There is a light scent, but nothing that bothers me. The shade range is great overall. The shade I got is good, but I could have gone one shade darker. I got 445N [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Beautiful foundation that lasts all day but doesn’t feel too heavy. I don’t wear foundation often but when I do, I look for products that last all day in a lovely package. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The shade changed from the last time I purchased this foundation, which ended up working great for me. The formula is new and has more of an updated formula, similar to YSL All Hours. The coverage is good and it lighter than before. The base is very good it has a very natural finish but also covers enough to be a base, the truth is I recommend it 100% [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received this complimentary from Lancôme and Influenster for an honest review.  This may be one of my favorite foundations. The product stays!! I wear it all day and it stays put. It has buildable coverage and goes on smoothly. I got a drop on my leg while getting ready and didn't even notice. Later that night I was the dark spot and laughed bc it had stayed put despite rubbing on my pants. The shade matched beautifully and I love everything about it. Including the packaging. I bought this August 31 2024 online and it expired September 2024. Not cool Sephora. So Now I’m wearing expired foundation. I just started to wear it today. March 30 2025. I can’t return it and I’m not going to throw it away.. This is a really nice foundation with a beautiful finish. I appreciate that it has spf in it but you can definitely smell it when you apply it which is something that I'm not a huge fan of. It definitely lasts a long time without breaking up and stays looking beautiful on my skin. Okay this foundation is expensive, but after using it, I can honestly say it is the best foundation I have ever worn.  It goes on beautifully and lasts all day.  It is the perfect finish and it doesn't settle into fine lines.  I start with Elizabeth Mott primer Thank me Later for mature skin.  Then use the Lancome Teint Idol ultra wear foundation.   Wow what a combo.  You have to try it! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I liked this foundation it lasted all day I do have dry skin and I felt like it was a little drying for me however that's a personal issue . The packaging is beautiful and luxurious as well as the smell If I had normal to combo skin I think this would have worked perfect. It's blends nicely you don't need a lot of product and comes of easily when washing your face ! This is the only foundation I use. It covers and lasts all day. I had been looking for a full coverage foundation for a long time and I was introduced to this foundation and I absolutely fell in love with the coverage it provides for me. It has a light feeling and doesn't make me break out. I finally found the right foundation and primer just had to spend a little more..but love it! This foundation provides good coverage that lasts for hours. I have oily areas and usually have to blot and powder my face a couple of times a day. Not with this! And with so many color choices, I found a good match. Wish the SPF was higher though. This is by far the best foundation. I have been using it for 10 years. My favorite Mac lipstick is cosmo but I have not been able to find it for a couple years. This foundation has been my go to at this point for years. I have some redness issues around my cheeks/nose and this foundation covers it so nicely. Buildable, long lasting, and is good and concealing T zone pores for me too. The finish is so natural, and I can use this on its own, or with finishing powder. Smooth and goes on nice with a sponge. Excellent coverage!  I can't say enough about good this product is and how the coverage is perfect for me, being 55 and my daughter who is 25 wears this brand when she wants more coverage. I will continue to buy! The color was good but the thin consistency settled right into my fine lines making them more visible even while wearing primer. I assume she loves because she bought it [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love this foundation! The finish is nice and the color was perfect. Great foundation for summer. Not too heavy at all. I like the pump on the bottle also. This is my favorite foundation This is the perfect foundation for mature skin.  Blends perfectly. Worked great Matched my skin color perfectly and lasted all night. I love this foundation. The color match is accurate. Buildable to full coverage while still feeling lightweight and breathable. Blends well and holds up for long term wear. Since my last foundation was discontinued , I was on a very expensive journey to find a foundation that was sweat proof and transfer resistant but also long lasting. This has been great so far and even wore it in 95+ degree weather with no smudge. The shade is a perfect match. I also love the way it applies though I would have preferred something more thinner and more hydrating. Product has great coverage. It works better for me when I use a moisturizer and before the moisturizer dries when applying. The lightest shade 085 was the perfect foundation for me for years. It's hard to find such a light shade. However now their lightest shade is way too dark for me. It's very sad they got rid of it It does not matter how much foundation I have in my collection, but I always have to have this foundation. One thing I learned about this foundation you can wear as like tinted moisturizer you can do full coverage. You can do light coverage and it gives you the coverage that you need my favorite love it. Emptied my first bottle and missed it. I didn't realize the formula had changed until I was trying to find my old shade. This one did not wear well and crept into lines and wrinkles. Wore off in areas by the end of the work day. I do admit that it went on smoothly and easily, it just didn't last. Not for my mature skin with the new formula. I have used Lancome foundation for over 20 years.  My boss wore it while giving birth and looked great after the baby was born.  I decided then I was switching to Lancome and have used it ever since.  It is flawless. Great coverage and so many shades to choose from. Stays on all day. I won't use anything else. I have tried many foundations and Lancôme is one of my favorites.    The coverage is amazing and it lasts, like it says, all day.   I ordered online and the shade finder found the correct shade for me.    Thank you Lancôme. Love this make up! I'm older and it does so well to not sit in and show wrinkles bad. It's a very buildable make up! Love it! This is my favorite foundation thus far! I love the way it sits on my skin and is buildable for a full coverage look. It's light and doesn't feel too thick. I took advantage of of the 21 days of beauty since they were half off and got two for the price of one, which is nice. 10/10 recommend! I usually have a hard time finding the right shade foundation when I order online. Not any more! The app suggested the ""perfect"" color for my skin tone and I'm thrilled with the coverage. Smooth and silky. This is the only foundation I'll wear.  It has great coverage and my face doesn't feel dry .  It gives great coverage all day! As a mature women dealing with hot flashes and all. This foundation really has been one of the best new finds for me. It doesn't feel heavy and  it has great coverage. Lancôme my Best Favorite BRAND!! It never disappoints ❤️ Wow, I was really impressed with this foundation. It gave me a smooth finish with full coverage; yet, it didn't feel heavy nor did it creases into my fine wrinkles. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This foundation feels so good on my skin. I put it on after allowing my moisturizer to dry and I was so surprised how well it blended into my skin since I never have good results with foundation matching. But Lancome said we got you! They have a diverse range of shades and coverage to match my darker skin. This gave me such smooth effortless coverage, I didn't need any blending, any powder, any blush – nothing else. I put this foundation on in the morning and wear it all day, it stays looking effortless all day. It has a light scent that fades once it dries and the product dries quickly. I also love that sunscreen is also right in the product, so I don't have to apply a separate sunscreen before applying foundation and then risking my skin feeling oily or sweaty in the Southern heat. Best of all, this foundation is well-suited to all day wear, it minimizes my pores and causes no irritation. Even though I wore this foundation on days when it has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the product has not sweated off. I have even accidentally fallen asleep with it on and had to get up and wash it off in the middle of the night, and still my skin was smooth and breakout free. As I have gotten older, my foundation needs have changed.  I have tried other brands, but keep coming back to this one.  It goes on smooth, the color match is phenomenal, and the sunscreen is necessary for a foundation product.  I want a dewy product that does not end up looking cakey and this one delivers.  It's a little pricey, but worth it. Love the coverage and feel of my skin with this foundation I've been shopping around for a liquid foundation that would work well for my mature skin.  It's my first time to try this foundation, and I absolutely love it!  I like that it has sunscreen protection.  Doesn't feel cakey or too thick.  Full coverage as it states; I did not have to have to use a concealer for some medium dark spots on my cheeks.  Lasted great through a 5 hour round of golf, in very warm and somewhat humid weather.  I'm so glad I found the perfect match for my skin and its needs. I usually get the tint but the full coverage was on sale and i ended tryijng it unfortunately i had to return it it gave me an allergy reaction a rash around my whole face. I'm a foundation freak. I've tried them all. This went on pretty but within an hour separated all over my face every attempt. I tried it with no primer, and 3 different primers. Not my jam. Went to to store to be color matched and to find a foundation for mature skin. A young girl help me and she was aware I was looking for. After I got home I realized my face was orange and foundation had already separated. Returned Yes I would buy this product again The coverage is excellent, and it looks beautiful when you first put it on. It also wears well throughout the day even with combination skin. However, due to oxidation, you'll no longer have a shade match and look like you're cosplaying a republican... There was a bit of confusion in the beginning with finding my shade, but I went to a different store and the new associate was amazing. I love that it looks natural, doesnt transfer, and lasts all day. YES! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Thank you lancome for sending this foundation for free to review.  Lancome makes great make up for dry skin. The teinte idole performed well all day on my skin.  I need a different shade but was glad to test this product. My favorite foundation I bought every time I could catch it on sale Was difficult to apply.  Dried down fast and was difficult to blend.  Settled into fine lines & pores and mad ethem stand out.  Not impressed for the price point. I've been an incredibly loyal wearer of this foundation for about a decade. The main reason for my loyalty has been my super pale skin. 90N of this foundation has historically been the only foundation available without special ordering that matches my skin and doesn't cause other problems. It is also been very longlasting. But in the last year or so they have CHANGED the color of 90N. I was hoping it was fluke, but its not. It is now too dark/orange for my skin. And there's no shade that's lighter.  Off to hunt for a new full coverage option for the days that's what I want. SHAME on you Lancome for changing an enduring and pretty perfect product. And shame for not providing shades for all skin tones anymore. We're not all olive skinned. I'd add photos to back this review up but I'm not seeing that option. I really wanted to love this foundation, especially with all the hype around its long wear and full coverage, but it didn't quite work for my skin type. I have drier skin, and the formula felt a bit too thick. Instead of giving me a smooth finish, it emphasized every pore and clung to dry patches, even with a good primer underneath.

That said, I will give Lancôme credit where it's due. The shade range is excellent. I was able to find a really solid color match, which isn't always easy. I appreciate the inclusive selection.

Overall, I think this foundation could be a great fit for someone with normal to oily skin. If you lean dry like me, you might want to proceed with caution or prep really well before applying. The girl who matched me, matched me wrong.
I bought this for vacation. When I put it on, it was way off. I looked so pale. I didn't catch it at the store because I can't see good without good lighting. I wished I would have tried it at home before I went on vacation. When I purchased my foundation it was the last one on the shelf and I was overjoyed. Great coverage!! And it last all day [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This had a great smooth texture and felt great on the skin. Once it was on for a bit I didn't notice any transferring to clothes which is great! This color was slightly dark on me so I'll probably need to wear during the summer. The packaging was really lovely! The pump worked great, too. New formula is not full coverage, but now ""buildable"". Oxidates, formula no longer fully sticks to the face. Foundation now comes off with sweat and tears within 8 hour use. Wore the original formula for years prior, even wore it to my grandpas funeral, with full on sobbing the foundation did not budge. Unlike the new formula, why am I still able to see my freckles and birth marks through the foundation. New formula feels like sunscreen sitting on the face. Even with 3 layers of building, it's not enough to fully cover. I used the entire bottle in hopes that every time I applied the experindcr would be different, not to mention the price of the foundation. New formula no longer upholds its intended said use. I have FINALLY found my perfect match after going through countless brands. 350N is perfect for neutral olives. I've tried practically every brand and this shade is literally my skin in a bottle. I have combo skin and love that it doesn't stick to my occasional dry patches but is still durable throughout the day as I put on and take off face masks during the day at my job. Love love love and am happy to spend my money on something that matches perfectly and caters to olive! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The bottle is a nice frosted glass and very heavy. The scent is a bit strong but it fades after a bit. The fountain oxidized a little after it was applied but not too much. It is more on the matte side but the coverage was stunning. Love this foundation! This has easily become my favorite foundation and I'm so happy I finally found it. I like both this one and the other one with the white cap. The shade I have matches perfectly. Beautiful coverage and wears well. Lancôme is ok but not as good as Estée Lauder. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have enjoyed this foundations wide variety of shades to better match your skin tone. It has a pleasant scent. The coverage lasts for an entire day with a nice matte finish. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have enjoyed this foundations wide variety of shades to better match your skin tone. It has a pleasant scent. The coverage lasts for an entire day with a nice matte finish. I don't typically write reviews for products, but this one warranted the post. I was fortunate enough to have access to one of Eau Claire's finest team members to help me find the best product for my skin type. She's directed me in the right direction before, and I will be seeking out her expertise again in the future! She recommended this product for me and was able to match my skin tone perfectly. It doesn't fill into fine lines and wrinkles and covers my combination skin in a way that other foundations haven't. My sensitive skin does not break out and I'm never worried about how I'll look in a couple hours. It lasts like no other and looks very natural. Love this Lancome product and am grateful for the help I received at the store! I always get complements on my make-up and skin when I wear this foundation. I get asked if it is natural or if I am wearing anything.  When I tell them it is foundation they ask for the name. I've used Lancôme foundation in the past and decided to go back as it's definitely a favorite. I didn't realize this had spf when I grabbed it. I noticed a little smell and difference in consistency. But wow!  It works great and I SHOULD be using spf!  Win win! This will be my third time trying to get this foundation from ulta. The last 2 bottles that I received have both been expired!! Be careful, they clearly have an issue with their inventory. I love this foundation as it doesnt disturb my acne prone skin and its very natural looking. Check the bottom of your box and back of the bottle to make sure you aren't getting expired product. I looked mine up and it was produced over 2 years ago! Then they really sent me another expired one. For a foundation this expensive that is unacceptable. I was in the market for a new foundation. Tried so many and not one mad me happy.  Somebody recommend this and thank goodness  it's what k have been looking for. It's light… makes my skin look beautiful.     I just love it I always get compliments when i wear this but understand this is not for everyone. I think the right prep is key to this. I love this Lancôme makeup! It gives me a full, natural-looking finish that feels lightweight and breathable all day. What's even better is that it has helped clear my acne, making it the perfect choice for my skin. Highly recommend for anyone looking for coverage without compromising skin health! [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Shade ranges are large- you'll find your shade and fast! Finish is good coverage and the packaging is beautiful. I love the glass container and I love how much you get for your buck! Try this out, you'll like it! This foundation is good.  It does not cover age spot to well, but over all it is good. Lancôme makeup has become a favorite makeup line of mine!  I used my last product for over 40 years and decided I needed to make a change because the stores were not convenient to go to.  I have found the coverage with the Lancôme foundation is excellent and better than previous makeup did.  The employees that are assigned to the Lancôme area are very knowledgeable about the line and are so willing to help and answer all your questions. This foundation is full coverage matte finish. I was unable to find  a shade to match my skin tone because I have an olive under tone that this product does cater to. I have combination oily and dry skin, I felt like the product caked up over my oily areas and was easily wiped off. There was some creasing after extended wear. The pro of this foundation is that its ingredients include hyaluronic acid and vitamin E suitable for someone looking for hydration and coverage. Overall I think there are better cheaper options for my skin type/color. I received this product in exchange for my honest Review this is amazing however I was sent the darkest shade and I am as pale as can be however I did wear test my arm for review. The coverage is perfect and fill.the finish is supple and beautiful.ot didn't have a strong scent at all which I appreciate. The packaging is nice and quality.and the shade range is great. This has been the only foundation ive used for over a year now. Is long lasting and covers blenishes well. Woukd recommend to everyone!! Excellent base in terms of its coverage and texture, it does not leave marks or part, I actually loved it and it lasts the whole day. The tone was a little dark, but I'm still enjoying it a lot. It's easy to work with and blend. Since they reformulated, I can't find  my shade.  
I had to start using Haus Labs foundation and I found my perfect match there. The employee went through about 5-6 shades and we couldnt find a match. So sad because I used this foundation for 10 years and it was my #1. I would get so many compliments on my make up too. I wish they brought back the old formula. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is truly a great foundation! One of the standout features for me is how weightless it feels on the skin, it's like wearing nothing, but with great medium to full build able coverage. The semi-matte finish is beautiful and looks so natural and smooth. 

I have oily skin so I wore it with the Hourglass Veil primer and was impressed with how well it held up throughout the day. Even when my natural oils started to come through in the evening, it didn't look greasy at all. Instead, it gave my skin a subtle dewy glow that looked fresh rather than shiny.

The only downside I noticed is with the shade range or the accuracy of the shades. When I first received it, I thought the color would be way too dark 345N , but it turned out to be a perfect summer match. Typically I would have picked a color in the 200N range considering I fall in the light skin tone range. To be honest, even for a summer shade I would have never gotten 345N which is for medium skin tone, assuming it would be far too dark. Usually for my summer shade I get a light medium shade. If I had picked it out myself based on what I usually go for, I probably would've ended up with something way too light. So definitely try it in person if you can. All in all, I absolutely love this foundation and will be purchasing it myself once I finish this bottle. Found the perfect warm tone shade! Very easy to blend and very buildable! Super hydrating not too heavy, would highly recommend as a go to natural look foundation. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a surprisingly lovely foundation. I loved the finish on my skin. I would describe it as a medium coverage foundation. I liked that the packaging allowed me to do partial pumps so that I could build up to my desired coverage. I didn't really notice any scent to this product at all. I love this foundation that I always order 2 for backup when I run out, it also has sunscreen so thats a plus to be protected by the sun! Absolutely, hands down, the BEST foundation i have ever used! I work at an airport and am constantly moving, sweating and rushing about. Every foundation I've ever used becomes greasy, cakey and transfers all over my uniform. 

NOT THIS ONE! My skin still looks just as perfect as when I left my house for work- almost 10 hours later. I originally bought thry estee lauder double wear and it sucked so bad. It wasn't blending well with my skin. I heard that lancome was similar in terms of being good for acne/oily prone skin, matte finish, and lonegvity so I decided to buy this. By far this is WAAYYY better than ELDW in my opinion and a few little pumps of this and blending it out with a sponge is just enough. People say that it does oxidize, I think it does a bit so just be sure to get a lighter shade. The coverage is amazing it covers most of my acne scarring and redness so I don't need to go in with too much concealer. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product was amazing. Felt very light in my skin not cakey, went on very easy, not strong odor, perfect coverage, great selection of shades. Will purchase in the near future. I have horrible eczema ridden skin, and this foundation does a great job at full coverage without that heavy cakey feeling. Color match is 10/10 this is my fav foundation next to mac lol still a mac girly! I have used this foundation for years. I absolutely love it. Looks so natural, covers incredibly well and lasts all day and into the evening, even after working out or being out in hot weather.
I have tried so many other foundations and always go back to this one. Nothing has been better. In all my seaons (pale winter, bronzed summer) I keep coming back to this foundation. It doesnt break me out, its like a second skin and looks beautiful on my oily, acne prone skin. HOWEVER, this does oxidize and it gets worse the lighter the shade. I thought I was going crazy wondering why my neck was starting to not match my face by the time I'd finish doing my makeup. I had to get a second opinion to comfirm. So while 135 is my shade, it oxidizes 2 shades darker. I had to go down to 115 and then THAT will oxidize into my actual shade. What the heck Lancôme??? You're $53+, start acting like it. Blends in very easily and is very easy to build up for more coverage. I applied it over a moisturizer and it did not pill or crease. I'm a medium light and the shade match was pretty accurate. The packaging fits nicely in my makeup back and the pump dispenser make it easy to use as much or little as I want. This was my first Lancome foundation product so I was super excited to receive. The color was slightly lighter than I needed, but i was able to work with it. The packaging was nice, as you would expect with a prestige foundation. The texture was thinner than most foundations I've used, but felt nice going on. The longevity was good, but I felt it looked better in the beginning than after a full day of wear. I've used many foundations so I wouldn't probably purchase this one when other lesser priced formulas perform as good or better. Funally found my perfect foundation after 10 years!! Ive used the previous formula of this foundation for 10 years. It was my #1 foundation ever for my skin. Ever since they changed the formula it has not been the same. Please lancome go back to the original formula. This new product makes my skin too cakey and oxidize making me look orange. I've tried three different shades to match my previous shade color and none of them worked :( [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice formula with nice coverage. The packaging was nice. I like that it has SPF, it lasted several hours with primer and finishing spray. My biggest complaint was that the color looked orange. This was very disappointing as it was labeled as a cool toned shade. I love how smooth my skin look after I apply the foundation, the fact that im wearing make up but also protecting my skin is a win win, the satine finish is so nice I wear it everyday because you can build it up if you want too but also as a tint with very little amount you cover all the Imperfections [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product has great coverage that not only feels light but stays all day. Perfect color match and smells great. Easy to use pump as well that keeps it fresh. I received this product in exchange for my honest review Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear melts into your skin flawlessly leaving a natural air brush finish without looking overly made up. It covers completely  without settling into fine lines and wrinkles . [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] My new favorite foundation! It is light weight and the color match is perfect. I love that it covers my dark spots without feeling too heavy on my skin. It doesn't settle in my fine lines either. I really love that ot has sunscreen in it to kill two birds with one stone. One and done products are a go for me. It makes me look flawless [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] It is not a full coverage so it didn't cover up my dark circles well. The shade is perfect because it wasn't a thick foundation. I don't recommend it for winter when we are more
Pale. Summer time this would work better this is probably worse than my cheapest foundations. it's dry, patchy, and separates so fast no matter how I apply it. I've tried everything. I exfoliate, use all my normal high end face products before applying and it still looks like crap a few hours later. I had high hopes for it because the concealer was not bad at all. never again. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I didn't like this product! It gets my skin really dry, the coloring is too heavy for me. I tried adding enough moisturizer but the result was the same! I was given this foundation as a gift from my sister in law, and I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and I'm also acne prone. usually if I  wear makeup too many days in a row I'll break out. This foundation hasn't made my face look oily later in the day and hasn't broken me out! It is pricey, but I'd be willing to get another bottle knowing it works better with my skin. This foundation may be ok, but i was a user of the old version, so it just doesn't fit my expectations. Ever since the formula/color name change i have been unable to find my true color match. I also find this version to be thinner. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This foundation offered great coverage!  My skin is fair and the shade I chose (220C) was a perfect match.  This product provides SPF 25 with its application and did not clog up my pores.  I finished this look with a light powder to set and forget.  All in all, easy to use and long lasting! Goes on smooth and doesn't feel heavy. The shade was perfect for me in the winter months. For someone who doesn't like the look of a full coverage foundation I have to say that I really liked this foundation. The texture is lightweight but provides impressive coverage. It blends easily, whether applied with a brush, sponge, or fingertips. I appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on the skin, even when built up to full coverage. I really wore this foundation on a humid day and I was out and about the whole day. My face did not budge. Everything stayed all together. Truth be told after buying this product once it literally is the only foundation I've bought since then with my own money. I'm addicted to the coverage and the color match. I love how it goes on smoothly and it doesn't oxidize and you can layer it in a way if you want a more full look or soft look seriously you need to purchase this if you haven't already, it will be your holy Grail in your make up routine. I promise you. If you want a full glam this is the foundation. Lots of shades to choose from too. Semi matte finish with buildable coverage. I used the product on a daily basis. It is a buildable makeup. Love the coverage. The shade match was off but i found it was a great match for my spray tan shade! Easy to use foundation. Can slightly emphasize texture but did look very pretty! I was finally able to try this product.  I have oily combination skin and was worried that this foundation would breakdown after a normal day.  It worked beautifully - blended well and didn't oxidize. I used my normal primer and setting spray and was highly impressed.  After trying so many matte formulas, I have found it! I will actually repurchase this foundation!I was finally able to try this product.  I have oily combination skin and was worried that this foundation would breakdown after a normal day.  It worked beautifully - blended well and didn't oxidize. I used my normal primer and setting spray and was highly impressed.  After trying so many matte formulas, I have found it! I will actually repurchase this foundation! This foundation is chef's kiss! Super lightweight, blends well and lasts all day without drying me out. it gives a soft matte finish but still looks like real skin. I really liked this product. I have combination skin so sometimes it gets oily & this foundation wasn't too drying & it kept me shine free throughout the day. The coverage was really great. But it turned orange color after a bit of applying. And it was cakey on my face. Lightweight breathable and buildable coverage 

Pros: 
I have really long days 12+ hours of being out of my home at work/school and this usually last me 7 ish hours before i notice any significant wear. Not too heavy it actually is pretty lightweight and breathable! 

Cons: 
I do think even thought it does last me a bit it will not withstand the texas heat which isn't surprising since most foundations aren't able to. I haven't been able to find the PERFECT match for me and i think im just an in between shade :( I really enjoyed this Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation from Lancome. I love the bottle and how it dispenses out the product.  The formula isn't too thick in consistency but glides on smooth on your skin. I did find this more of a medium coverage (I'm fine with that). It looks very natural on your skin and the color was perfect. I use a setting spray but with it I had no issues with oxidizing and it stayed put ALL day. Definitely recommend! I think people looking for more of a natural slightly radiant coverage would prefer this. If you like full coverage this might not be for you. I prefer to use with a sponge. I feel I get more coverage that way. I'm not one to use foundations that are not matte, but this was a nice surprise. It's slightly dewy without making my face look like a smeared oil across it. Great foundation! Doesn't cling to dry patches on my face or make me look greasy Feels smooth to apply and looks even smoother on the skin. Highly recommend for those looking for a full coverage look without a heavy feel. I've been using this product for a few years. The texture is easy to blend with foundation. I love this formula it feels lightweight and coverage is buildable with a light hand and good hydrated skin you can barely see I'm wearing foundation. However on winter when my skin is too dry you can really see texture and patchy. I love this on the summer I need to try the glowy formula for winter It's a beautiful foundation that feels nice and light on the face unfortunately it has to have a lot primer and setting spray otherwise it moves all over Incredible foundation. Has been my favorite for a decade. Try it. You won't be disappointed!! Have used the Teint Idole for years. Love the coverage and colour choices I have always used this foundation since I tried it 5 years ago. This foundation is a staple in my makeup routine.  Shade match is on point.  Easy to use and buildable. This foundation is a staple in my daily makeup routine.  Smooth finish.  Perfect shade.  Doesn't smell like most foundations do. I have been using this foundation for years. Good coverage! Love this product! good for my oil skin look good on camera  will recommend to friend Used many brands this one is the best for me good coverage for my spots and can be hold for almost one day. Love this foundation! I have been using it for about 2 years love this product I love the texture and application of this foundation. The color was perfect for me, and it layered well with my other skincare and makeup products. The matter finish lasted nearly all day for me, with light activity. I bought it last year and use it when I have event  it is stable enough and my face is like natural and bright Definitely a great rating because it's great on my face and has silky smooth texture! Love the lightness and glow of Lanc√¥me foundations and have been loyal through several formula changes. I am a long-term skin care user and take advantage of the GOP Seasonal and gala gifts. Lately I have jumped between Estee Lauder Chanel and Lanc√¥me for make-up. The Hypnose mascara and foundation from Lanc√¥me remain my favourites however I will jump ship with the eyeshadows and other products due to a bad experience with a severe allergy to the eyeshadow. The color appears significantly lighter than displayed on website. This foundation has gotten considerably more expensive since I started using it years ago which I would be able to accept if it wasn't for the fact that  the quality has decreased substantially. The most recent bottle I ordered looks very dry on my skin and doesn't offer buildable coverage. It is not as good as it used to be. I can no longer recommend it for the price. I think this is a very high quality product. I have been using Lancome cosmetics for about 35 years. I ordered 2 TIENT IDOLE ULTRA WEAR to replace a Teint Idole Ultra Wear SPF 15 Broad-spectrum foundation expecting it to be the same product.  To my surprise the new product has changed with no sun protection and the coverage is less than the original I have been using. Been using this foundation for 10years and even with the latest update it is the best long lasting liquid foundation that doesn't cake goes on smooth.Covers well and gives natural look I'm 49 and this makeup gives me great coverage without settling in any fine lines. Long wearing with a beautiful matte finish. Medium, buildable coverage. felt nice on the skin, good for everyday use I bought this one month ago and I am very happy. It's very easy to apply Is so amazing for foundation teint idole! I look like my idole! Love love It seem to be not as smooth as what I think .Just Ok always buying this one with the discount even better It is easy to apply and leaves natural looks on the skin. it is very gooooood and i love it and it can make my skin more smooth I like this product so much I recommend it for all my friends Foundation is light and stay on your face for all day long. The only foundation I recommend. I really like how this item covers and blends with the skin. I have been using this for a long time. One downside is they keep changing the numerical values This foundation gives a natural skin finish. I have oily skin and it doesn't leave my skin greasy and shiny. I haven't broken out either, which is a huge plus for my problem skin type. Reduces redness and covered up blemishes and dark spots fairly well. I recommend giving it a try. This is my 3rd bottle and each bottle last for few months. You don't need to put a lot. I bougth It for my oil.skin I have a lot of problema with my makeup fix.. this product makes me a soft and dry slin I glad I chosen the right color and seems the coverage is good. I tried a lot of expensive foundations from different brands. After a joruny of many years iI decided to STICK wiyh  lancome foundation  it is light  very natural. I bought it for the first time and I am so happy about it Used to be my favourite foundation been wearing it for over 6 years. Then they reformulated it and that product is still good but my shade no longer exists. I used to wear 110C and it was my PERFECT shade match now it's almost 2 shades darker. Please bring back a cool toned very fair shade 90 is too yellow on me when it oxidizes. This foundation is my go to for day and night and all types of climates . Favourite Foundation that I've used so far! Lightweight yet stays on whole day. I tested this Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation and got it for free from BZZZ Agent.  It was a great product, it lasts all day, matched my complexion perfectly, and lasts for a long time I tried the foundation with and without primer. It is very easy to build and feels luxuriously smooth. I prefer a more natural look and this perfectly blends away minor imperfections, evens out skin tone and reduced the appearance of redness so well I did not need color or blemish correction. The coverage lasts throughout the day without touch ups. I can see it being my everyday foundation and not just special occasions. I have been using this for years. Although I wish Lancome would bring back colour 160 as it matched my skin perfectly I still enjoy using this product even though colour 130 doesn't look quite as good as the old colour. This is my new favorite foundation. It feels light and breathable. I don't like anything on my skin that feels like its caked on there so this works really well for me I like this matte foundation, it's like medium coverage to me and didn't cause any breakouts on my skin , easy to apply but you will need a double cleanse to get it off your face… Finally I found a perfect match for my brown skin. I blends very well and covers my aches and pigments perfectly. I step outside confidently with clear coverage. I recently received this  Idole foundation I tried as a sample first time , in exchange for my honest review and loved it from the beginning, so I bought the whole product. Right off the bat I noticed it has lots of color to chose from, Great foundation that is lightweight, buildable, and long wearing. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate it. I like that there is no heavy fragrance. The only thing is that it doesn't blur imperfections and texture as well as I would like, so make sure you use primer and create a good base underneath. I love just about everything that comes from Lancome from the skincare to the make up. This concealer definitely lives up to the brand name. My only gripe is that you would need a moisturizer underneath otherwise it does tend to get a little dry. I love the feeling of this foundation. It's very lightweight and build able. It has great coverage without looking cakey. The color match on my skin is spot on. I absolutely love the Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation! This foundation feels very lightweight on the skin but gives amazing coverage. It evens out my skin tone, hides redness, and covers any little blemishes without looking heavy. One of the best things about this foundation is how long it lasts. I put it on in the morning, and it still looks fresh by the evening without needing to touch it up. Even on hot days, it doesn't slide off or fade. It also has a natural matte finish that looks smooth but not dry, so my skin looks polished but not shiny.

It's very easy to apply, whether I use a brush, sponge, or even my fingers. I just need a small amount to cover my whole face, so the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it worth the price. The color range is fantastic, so it's easy to find a perfect match for my skin tone. Overall, I highly recommend the Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation if you want a long-lasting, full-coverage foundation that still feels light and natural. It's perfect for everyday use and even special occasions. I love this foundation from Lancome !!! It last long all day. I love how easy it blends on my skin and very lightweight. This foundation brings a smooth and medium coverage,  not too thick which I love the most. But if you have a dry skin, should put on moisturizer really well before use this foundation or it will dry out your skin after. Overall, I really like this Foundation and it will be my Favorite One. Highly recommend!!! I think this foundation is a pretty great option for people looking for something that won't look different every day. Whether my skin was more dry or more oily that day, it still had the same finish and had similar lasting power. This is foundation, and looks as such, so don't expect it to look like a BB cream or a tinted sunscreen, but it definitely does it's job. As with all my other experiences with foundation, it does settle into pores a little bit and will emphasize your texture if it is particularly visible. It has great coverage and doesn't look cakey as long as you don't apply too much -- a little goes a long way! I found blending it out with a damp sponge was my favorite way to apply this foundation. Tr√®s satisfait recommand√© je vais l'acheter pour les prochaines fois Product went on very well and lasted a long time.  Very easy to use and was able to blend with ease. As a 50 year old woman, finding a foundation that doesn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles is key.  If it also offers additional benefits such as hydration and brightening, that is a bonus.  I was given a sample of the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear and it exceeded my expectations.  It was creaseless and left my skin smooth and even.  If is a full coverage foundation and a little goes a long way.  The beautiful finish left me with a healthy glow all day! I did the shade finder test on Lancome and got 335W which was too yellow for me. Regardless I did a test wear and found the foundation to be buildable but not patchy on my combination skin. Blended well with my other products which are both drugstore and high end. I would love to try thos out again with the correct shade. I loved the coverage my Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation gave. It went on with ease nice and smooth. I love that they have so many shades to choose from that I had no problem finding my perfect skin shade. It goes on so smooth. Feel light it's not heavy or cake. You can build up the coverage. I'm absolutely in love with this foundation's formula! It has a beautifully smooth texture that blends seamlessly with my skin, giving me a natural, flawless look. What I love most is how buildable it is. I can layer it for a bit more coverage without it ever looking caky or heavy. It feels lightweight on my skin, but still provides enough coverage to even out my complexion and hide any imperfections. This is my new go-to foundation! It's medium coverage but buildable, and it didn't break me out even with my sensitive skin. Plus, it really blurs my pores. I love it so much — totally worth it! The shade was slightly darker than my skin color, perfect for my summer tan. This cover up lasted all day, and it didn't feel heavy and oily. It had a light breathable coverage that hides all imperfections perfectly! This product is so easy to use and apply and gives you that natural look! I love to use this for my everyday natural look! I was pleasantly surprised with how lightweight this foundation was, while being full coverage. I usually have a hard time with medium or full coverage  foundation because it becomes Cakey or makes my skin look flakey but not this one. It covers all the flaws I want it to but feels like I'm only wearing a bb cream. I would absolutely buy this product again. Lancome teint idole ultra wear foundation
I chose the shade 345N but I feel like it is nowhere close to neutral. I was very disappointed with the shade range. I have neutral with warm olive undertones and the shade description for 345N seemed to be perfect. Other than disappointing shade range, I really like the sleek frosted bottle. I like the fact that it has SPF 15. Not that I rely on foundation for sun protection, but I'll take any extra protection. Despite being advertised as a matte foundation, I like the natural finish it provides. It has good coverage and sets on my skin after application. Overall it has the potential to be a great foundation, if you can find your perfect match. I like how lightweight this foundation is. It comes out of the pump smoothly and easily. I will need a slightly different shade when I purchase for myself. I have natural oily skin in some spots and this foundation was perfect. I had full coverage with a matte finish that left my skin looking perfectly soft and smooth. My complexion was perfectly even out, I definitely have no complaints - all of my blemishes were minimized to the point I could hardly notice them at all. My skin tone was enhanced in a way I never thought possible. I would definitely share this secret with all my friends. The Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation is wonderful. It provides a nice coverage while feeling incredibly lightweight on my skin.The finish is natural- not cakey, and it stays put without needing constant touch-ups. Perfect for anyone looking for a foundation that lasts and feels barely there. Highly recommend! I am a cc cream wearer for the past 10 years. I love the dewy look and youthful texture. This was my first time using a matte product that looked like my natural skin and non drying. It layered well with my moisturizer and blush and bronzers and made my skin look even. The color was the best match out of any foundation I've ever tried. And the packaging looks high end on my counter top. Feels weightless. Love the product. this foundation for a couple weeks, and its solid, but doesn't beat out my personal favorite.  It goes on smooth and provides great coverage with excellent staying power.  It just feels a little heavier than I like. Goes on smooth blends well!! Feels like air and will not rub off!! This tint is so lightweight and medium coverage. I love applying this when I want to look natural but still cover up my under eyes. It's perfect and lightweight and it does the job. A little goes a long way. I tried this foundation for a few weeks and it has a good amount of coverage and is easy to apply. I do have to use a specific primer with it or else it starts pilling for me. other than that i like the finish that his foundation has Excellent coverage the texture isn't oily witch it's perfect I have very oily combination skin and this is the foundation I come back to year after year. It is getting a lot pricier but it still works. This product is so lightweight and still very full coverage. Has a beautiful matte finish. I really like this foundation. It applies on smooth and it has great coverage After trying this product for the last few weeks, I have fallen in LOVE. My skin is combo and the coverage lasted all day. No break up at the end of my shifts. It's not my favorite but works in a pinch for light weight coverage Natural looking long wearing foundation! It blends nicely and evenly. It gives me the coverage I need while also giving my skin a glow! I normally wear a skin tint since I can't stand the heavy feeling of a foundation or the make-up'y look of it. I was pleasantly surprised that I can get medium coverage and long wear with Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear foundation without any of the negatives, so thank you Bzz Agent for the free product. I wore it to a dance class and it stayed and kept my face natural rather than shiny looking through it as well as several hours later without touchups. Love the beautiful glass bottle, which feels solid and looks great on my bathroom countertop. Pump works well, too, and doesn't spew out too much product. 

It did make my pores look more noticeable, which is why I gave this foundation 4 and not 5 stars, so a good primer and skin prep are essential before using it. For reference, I have normal to slightly dry aging olive light medium skin with neutral undertones and 330N was a near perfect match for me. I love this product it's perfect coverage and shade I love texture of it This product is simply amazing. I have never found a product with perfectly blendable, buildable coverage that is also breathable! Products always melt my face as soon as I step outside, but this gave me a flawless look ALL DAY long, I even put it to the test when we took the kids out for a fun fall day at the farm and it was 80 degrees! I still looked great!",4.2,300
NARS Light Reflecting Foundation,"This has been my first experience with a higher end foundation. I use a light layer after my primer and before my concealer. It produces a nice layer of even coverage and blends in to my skin. But after some time I notice the texture of my skin looks a bit more noticeable and rough. I think the product does this after drying. But it's only when viewed up close, so I dock one star for this. If I purchase again I'll get a lighter, less peachy shade, as it looks a tiny bit orange on me. I like this foundation my skin look natural and glowy , it’s work with me as sensitive dry mature skin It doesn’t match my skin and not full coverage 
I ask them for correct ones but they gave me wrong I will shout it from the rooftops that the NARS Light Reflecting Foundation is one of the best foundations on the market. I think I’m on my 5th bottle now and I am so, so happy with how it leaves my skin looking youthful and dewy. 10/10 my holy grail ! She sits so beautiful, buildable, and doesn’t cling onto my dry patches. Versatile too, you can build your base to look airbrushed or if you like more of a natural skin like base, this  is it I have dry, sensitive skin so when i was recommended this this product I was so excited to give it a try! Unfortunately it just made my face look super dry and dull. LOVE the actual foundation.  A perfect match for my skin, absorbs evenly, no reaction to my skin.  On this, again: LOVE!   BUT, as I see others mentioning, the pump is too stiff.  I don't always like a full face-worth of pump, but rather just a touch to conceal trouble spots.  I cannot control the amount that comes out.  At this price, if I don't want full coverage, I want to save product for the next day.  So, keep the product the same but fix your pump, NARS. I've used it many times in many events, I have to say it's full coverage, I also pair it with nars concealer which is the best combo is your have acne marks and all. Foundation looks great on my skin. I like the light reflecting properties. It is easy to apply. Gives my skin a nice smooth, natural finish This is the best colour match I’ve ever had 🤩 I’m very fair with cool undertones and I don’t even have the blend this down my neck. The coverage and the finish are divine 🥰 It’s also SO lightweight. Truly my perfect foundation. This is the prettiest foundation I have ever tried, and I have tried so many! I wish I had bought it back when Wayne Goss first raved about it. I start by shaking the bottle, applying a pump to the back of my hand and mixing it with my finger before applying it in dots across my face.m, and then I use a sponge to blend it. The foundation perfects the skin, making it look hydrated, alive, and healthy. It can be layered without ever looking heavy. It never separated on me, and looks so natural that I keep being told I have beautiful skin instead of nice makeup. I work and attend nursing school full time and even by the end of the day this foundation never separates on me or gets oily. I have recommended it to my mom in her mid 50s, and she loves it as well. I was paranoid to review it as I didn’t want to jinx it (I had reviewed the dior airflash foundation before it was DCd and loved it, then it broke me out). After using this every day for more than a month, with my skin looking healthier than ever, I can confidently say this is the best foundation I have ever tried. After years of searching, I've finally found the perfect foundation for me. I'm 44, and tinted moisturizer wasn't cutting it anymore, but I absolutely hate the feel of heavy foundation on my skin. This is the perfect amount of coverage for me. It feels like nothing on my skin, is very buildable, and blends beautifully. I use the Nars concealer as well and they are the perfect combo, IMO. Great looking foundation on my dry/normal 35 year old skin. It looks very skin-like, the coverage isn’t too heavy, and it catches light well. I love how it looks! I have tried using other foundations, but I always go back to this! I would purchase again and again My go to for every day. Blends well and lasts! Love it and it’s way better than the Armani foundation! No one can tell I’m wearing foundation. Super hydrating for dry skin. This foundation is underrated as good as Armani sometimes when my skin acting up even better. Love it! This foundation looks okay on, but the smell when putting it on is so rank that I thought it had gone bad. Coverage is light-medium, finish is skin-like, not super dewy or overly matte. I have mostly neutral slightly pink undertones. I think this is slightly yellow and slightly dark for me. AND IT SMELLS TERRIBLE! It matches my tone So perfectly I recommend with someone who wants full coverage This is my go-to, everyday foundation and I have yet to find a close second in my ""everyday makeup routine"" category.

If you like a light-weight, buildable to medium coverage foundation, I highly recommend this one. I have been using this for 2 years and I've purchased a second bottle. I have dry skin and this doesn't feel cakey or sticky, despite humidity and sweat.

I would say this foundation is an inbetween of a natural and a radiant (not glowy) look. But it is easily mattifiable with a mattifying powder.

If there's anything I want to be improved in this product is the pump. Product spills over around the sides, but not in a drastically messy nor in a wasteful way though. I ordered 3 of three of the sample sizes to try to find my skin match. La Serena was probably the closest but looked very unnatural, New Caledonia and Namibia were all way off. The consistency is very watery and messy. The shades have odd undertones and are not flattering. its 2025 it shouldnt be this hard to get a good match Blind bought this shade online after my local store hadn’t had it for a while to sample. Nailed it. Went on great and worked amazingly all day. Very watery consistency, I shakes the bottle for a while hoping it would help. However, I shouldn’t have to shake a bottle for a while before applying it. It’s not convenient to apply because of the consistency, I wouldn’t recommend pumping it on the face or a brush because it just drips, I would find myself using a lot of profduct just to apply to my face. The bottle got very messy the first time I used it, the entire pump of the bottle is smothered in foundation, my fingers got dirty, Was ok, but not sure of the hype. Applied ok but almost seemed like it didn’t have any coverage. I tried multiple shades. It just didn’t do much Dispenser broke not long after purchasing. I tried to exchange at Sephora but was told there was nothing they could do because I was a couple days past the 30 day return policy. This foundation gives coverage without feeling heavy or greasy. I have oily skin And this one stays mat all day. I love this makeup. I bought it for my vacation and the pump did not work it was stuck. I had to put tape when travelling. Literally my go to foundation! i have been using this for years! it glides on to my skin smoothly and lasts all day. i have yet to find another comparable one. I seriously get compliments every time i wear this foundation! The foundation is amazing, feels good in my skin and color matches perfectly. The dispenser/pump is a problem. The pump gets stuck, releases,makes a mess, and wastes the product. Very disappointing. I use this foundation every single day - it’s one of the only super pale foundations I have found that isn’t super white or have a yellow undertone! It has the slightest pink undertone which is amazing if you are a pale person with a rosy look! Love love love:))) The dispenser is AWFUL - it is so challenging to keep from the makeup violently splattering out each pump all over the place and you easily waste more product with this type of pump. Pretty please change it This is a good foundation but it’s definitely for lighter coverage rather than medium. I do love it though! It matches my skin well and is buildable and blends well too. I still prefer the natural radiant and soft matte foundations by nars bout The product initially felt good, giving my skin a glowy and dewy look... but it ultimately led to breakouts. I was so disappointed. I basically bought it to cover my pigmentation. But rarely doing the job. It’s good but not working for me. Decent coverage - made me break out. Not purchasing again. I was helped in the store by the manager, who was super nice and helpful. She matched this foundation perfectly to my skin to the point it’s almost as if I wasn’t wearing it at all. Love this foundation! Starting using this foundation and I love it. A little goes a long way and it’s also so light and I barely feel it on. Don’t like it, planning to return. Looks awful on my 58 year old face. Disappointed The product arrived leaked and very messy. Unfortunately, it was unusable. Love this product! As a Sephora employee, I’ve been using it since it launched a few years ago. It’s super hydrating, leaves a beautiful glow on the skin and doesn’t feel heavy after wearing it all day! The coverage is a gorgeous medium finish. I recommend this product to most clients who come by! I really wanted to love this foundation, but it just didn’t work for me. On my skin it made my complexion look dull and seemed to emphasize my pores. The coverage and wear time were fine, but the I LOVE this foundation, beautiful finish however I am not a fan of the scent. It has a huge paint smell. Could just be mine though. I have never been a foundation person, and have always opted for concealer to spot correct any imperfections in my skin, but this foundation has completely changed my mind! It is so light, it feels like nothing on my skin, (which was a major deterrent from other foundations and the main reason I disliked using them) yet it provides the most beautiful flawless coverage that still mimics my skin, but so much better. Wears well through the day, I look just as polished leaving work as I did when I arrived. Very impressed, and finding I don't reach for concealer at all anymore because this foundation is doing the heavy lifting for both products! This foundation melts into your skin and makes it glow like no other. It lasts all day if you use primer and some setting powder. 

I wore it to a red carpet event and people stopped and asked me how I got that glow. 

Nothing else compares with how stunning this makes your skin. I never wear foundation because I don't like a heavy makeup look, but now I want to wear this everyday. 

It's helpful that it has so much skin care in it too. Makes my skin feel soft and healthy.

It's medium coverage but buildable, especially if you use a concealer to hide blemishes and dark spots.

Other makeup sits beautifully on top of it. This is my favorite foundation for my sensitive, combo skin. I use shade Deauville (L4), which matches perfectly. It gives medium coverage that easily covers my sun spots while leaving my skin looking flawless and dewy. Works beautifully even on aging skin—truly a staple in my routine. I am 50 and have had a terrible time finding foundation for mature skin but so far this has been my favorite. It’s nice and glowy but not too glowy, my face is on the dry side so I really like that. My only complaint is that the shades seem to run pretty yellow so o had to make do I love this foundation. great coverage. shiny silky finish. switched to it from the sheer glow formula and find it less heavy on the face but still great coverage. perfect foundation. I remember trying this foundation in the past and hating it because of the shade match. I am a fair olive that needs less saturated shades. All of Nars shades are extremely pink or ORANGE, until Lima! I was very excited to finally be able to try an acceptable match. 

The color was fine, it could be less saturated but the best of any Nars shade. The formula felt a little heavy for me. It definitely has a makeup feel unlike most of my medium-coverage options. That's the first ding. 

The coverage and look were decent. I liked the finish for the most part, though it doesn't look like skin as much as many foundations. It definitely is a you're wearing makeup foundation. 

The worst part is skincare inside of it. I wish brands would STOP doing this. I have my own skincare. Whatever is in this stuff made me breakout badly, and I AM NOT AN ACNE PRONE/OILY GIRL. It really annoys me at this point. I’ve spent the last ten years of my life wearing tinted moisturizer and I was a little wary about trying something with medium coverage. It’d be heavy, right? Wrong. This is so lightweight while being a powerhouse at covering my redness and PIH (changing hormones to help my endo really did a number on my skin.) Two squirts is too much to cover my face but I use a small brush and apply the rest as concealer where I need it. Solid wear with a primer, mid-day I feel slightly shiny but a translucent powder cuts that so easily. This foundation was made for me. Sephora wanted to match me with something a whole level darker but I went with my heart and grabbed a lighter one, and I’m so glad I did. It blends seamlessly with my jaw and neck. I have been using this foundation for 18 months now,  I have dry and mature skin and this one by far my most bought foundation.  I have try a lot of foundation but this is still most love. i received this product as a gift. this primer is soooo good. makes my foundation set so well and i look so glowy. i cannot wait to repurchase more and keep using it. will definitely recommend to everyone. I am 56 with aging skin and after moving to AZ I needed something lighter for my skin, but I like natural and not heavy.  I have true combo skin.  I have tried countless tinted moisturizers, BB creams etc since moving here and nothing works! I walked in Sephora to try one last time, and I walked by this and the girl said the color I picked up matches me perfectly. I thought ok I'll give it a try.  I LOVE IT! It's literally perfect in every way! I use Sheglam primer under it and it's amazing.
I don't understand the negative reviews, but everyone's skin is different.  I have lines, and combo skin and it looks amazing and feels even better. I had used the foundation a of couple times quite a few years ago because my friend had it and she let me use it for different occasions. I LOVED IT THEN!! So I finally bought some myself this year and I… hated it??? I’m not sure if the formula changed or my skin but this foundation slips and slides all around! I can’t use enough setting powder or setting spray and this foundation just does not stay all day at all. It looks worse as the day goes on, even just a couple of hours :( this is the best foundation on the market, it was my wedding day foundation, i will be buried with it. it oxidizes a bit due to the light reflecting element but the formula is lightweight, comfortable, and wears beautifully throughout the day. The pump was stuck in the cap. Defective product. As it’s an expensive product, Extremely disappointed Best foundation, lasts ALL day and looks like skin!! For reference I have normal to oil skin in the summer and dry skin in winter. The foundation is great all year round. This product is awesome, will recommend to all my friends. I am using this foundation from last 1 year and i just love this foundation. My skin is super dry and this foundation is best for dry skin. It makes skin so smooth and soft. Looks Very natural and dewy. Defective Pump – Very Disappointed

‏I purchased this NARS liquid foundation in April and used it only a few times. Recently, the pump got completely stuck inside the cap, making the product unusable. I went to the store, but since more than one month had passed, they refused to replace it and asked me to contact customer service. Unfortunately, customer service was not helpful either.

‏I am very disappointed because this is clearly a product defect, not misuse, and I expected better support from Sephora. I received this in the complexion trial bag from Sephora. I had had a good experience with Nars a long time ago, so I was excited to try this. On taking it on my fingers, the foundation felt good, and I was hoping I would love it. But, on applying it to my face, it highlighted dry patches that I didn't even know existed. It also made my pores more noticeable. i dont own or use any foundation and needed one for my pre wedding dinner and this was absolutely stunning on my face in pics and in real life!! not cakey, not tacky and such a perfect coverage. I don't understand why a brand would use the same name for two different foundations if the color/undertones are not exactly the same. I am a super light NEUTRAL. This ""Mont Blanc"" reads orange on me even with an unpigmented translucent powder over it. I'm so incredibly disappointed and now have to return and attempt to find a better match. The lighter shades in this range have very clear pigments though- a pinkish one and another that reads yellow. I've included pictures below so you can compare to my old sheer glow foundation that is no longer sold on sephora. I bought this product for my mother and she has mature skin. It does give her full coverage, but I still think that the formula could be a little improved. Can’t go wrong with this foundation. Great coverage, wears well. NARS has reliable foundations. I will definitely repurchase! Best foundation!!!! Coverage is everything !!! A little bit goes a long way and it last for a long time ! I stopped wearing foundation for about 6 years and started wearing tinted moisturizers. I decided to see what the all the rave was about this foundation and…they aren’t kidding! I have never had a shade match this good in my life, and the foundation lasted my entire 8 hour shift without budging! It’s so good go get it! I have been searching for years to find a foundation that works well for my skin. I have acne scars and I have tried so many foundations but they would always make my skin appear dry and cakey. Not the case with NARS light reflecting! This foundation is beautiful and doesn’t appear cakey at all. I first applied it with a brush and then used a damp beauty blender to melt it into my skin (the beauty blender really helped the foundation appear like skin!) I did use the NARS pot concealer just to cover some of my stubborn scars (but you could honestly do without it) and put the foundation on top and it looked beautiful!! My skin looks blurred and healthy. I finally found a foundation that I love! Love this product ! Color is great and the color is perfect . Very happy with this foundation and make my skin look great and is gentle love it. I've used the product a few times and everytime no matter my skin prep is very dry. It emphasized my texture to the gods and after a couple of hours or rather a couple of minutes made me look the shade of an extra dirty martini (a weird yellowish green). Now I could probably make this work for me with some coloring pigments but I shouldn't have to make a $54 foundation work for me, it already should. Very disappointing for my first foundation. I really like this foundation for the winter, as I am more oily/combo.  I’ve always used Yukon and now that shade is discontinued.  Yulong is not right either.  It’s too light.   The next shade looks too peach on mr. Not for me. Heavy, strong smell and makes my skin very dry. I bought this because I watched a video that the makeup artist who created this foundation loved to apply with fingers and that was exactly what I was looking for somthing I cloud put on fast before work that looked skin like and it did not disappoint! I will only buy this from now and their is a good shade range I got shade matched in store and it’s the closest I’ve ever got to my skin! Seriously. OMG. Sometimes, makeup just needs to be makeup. As a sensitive skin, highly acne-prone girly, I am so frustrated by the trend lately where every. single. foundation. has to somehow be infused with hyaluronic acid, or some other on-trend ingredient.

Reliable formulas I've loved for years, some for more or less a decade, I now have to abandon because they reformulate, which leads to one or more of the following effects:

1) The makeup just sucks. It oxidizes, or comes out of the tube darker or some other tone than it used to, and generally doesn't match what it used to. 

2) It breaks you out. A makeup that used to be the HG for breakout-prone girlies is now part of the problem because they force ""skincare"" into the formula. So those of us who spent years hunting and came to rely on a foundation now have to abandon it and are shunned as loyal customers. 

3) It separates. More often than not, the ""skincare"" being blindly mixed into these foundations is not meant to mix with the types of formulas in the makeup. So you end up with a foundation that ends up separating on your face and looking disgusting, whereas the original formula used to last an entire day, .

I am so deeply disappointed and frustrated with the makeup industry lately. I can barely find a single cosmetic that doesn’t tout some “skin saving” ingredient anymore, and all I want is a simple foundation and concealer. I’m not interested in paying more for makeup that doesn’t even work half as well as it used to.

Please please PLEASE go back to just letting makeup be makeup, and skincare be skincare. All time favorite foundation easily. Makes my skin glowy and healthy and it has never caused me acne. It actually improves my skin. The only thing I wish was better was the shade range. Super pretty and gorgeous finish, i have an oily T zone so products like this don't last too long (naturally. not any products fault.) It does however break my skin out a little :( Oh my gosh I’ve tried sooo many different foundations and this one is the best by far. I have dry skin and this helps to hydrate it. What stood out most to me is that it doesn’t oxidize or separate! So amazing This foundation is great when I am looking for full coverage. It really does the job well. The only reason I did not give a 5 star was the price. I’ve tried multiple foundations and THIS is the one. It offers good and even coverage and it lasts so well. Even if I’m sweating with my glasses, it doesn’t separate. Actually worth the price. As an ex-Sephora employee I’ve tried so many different foundations. My skin has also changed over the years. I used to love super matte, full coverage foundations but now that I’m in my early 30’s I prefer buildable natural finish foundations. This one is my number one pick. I’ve been using it for about 3 years now and it’s the first foundation that I have finished repeatedly and repurchased repeatedly. I’ve used it in all seasons and the performance never disappoints. It is also one of the ONLY foundations that has an exact colour match. I’m extremely neutral with olive/rose and peach undertones. Some foundations pull much too olive, too yellow or too peach. This one is perfect. I always recommend it to any one everyone. This foundation sucks. I use a water based primer but it still looks soooooo splotchy and just doesn’t blend. And it transfers super easy even with setting spray. I have oily skin but it manages to also somehow cling to the few dry patches I have. only foundation i ever use, have been buying it over and over for years. literally best foundation you could ask for, nars be knowing their foundation products One of my favorite foundations. Have switched to a skin tint but this is what I would repurchase. My favourite foundation for years, with acne prone texture skin with acne scarring, this blurs beautifully. It’s great on any type of skin. Price has gone up a little too much the last year so the Dior backstage has become another favourite for a better price. But this wears amazing all day and will always be a staple This is a good natural looking foundation . The shades are wonderful and natural looking. I’ve had many compliments on my skin.It’s a perfect match for my skin tone. I am still looking for the best primer to use with it I wish I had purchased this OG years ago! It’s fantastic, and I will be repurchasing. It’s light weight but solidly medium coverage. I apply with my fingers and finish with a brush or sponge. After using this product for a while. I love the medium coverage that it gives. It evens out the skin tone color to one, blends nicely with my neck color. I use for days that I don't feel like putting on heavy makeup and just want something easy, light and simple. This foundation has an easy blend and great finish BUT 2 hours after wearing makeup it starts to break apart no matter how I prepare my skin and the prime I use. I’m not a huge fan of this. The coverage is light and even but it’s shiny unless I use powder. Also it creasing on me after a while and sets into my pores. Like this foundation a lot but the bottle is horrible! Leaks everywhere and do not fly with it…bottle exploded all inside my makeup bag and had to throw away the bottle that was brand new Great formula, lightweight, medium coverage, beautiful satin finish with just the right amount of shine. Any foundation will aggregate acne a little bit but this one is one of the best at doing as little damage as possible. However, the packaging is awful Dry looking especially if you have dry patches it will cling to them. Lowkey looks dusty after an hour or 2 This is my go to that I will keep coming back to. Hard to top this! I used this foundation a couple of years ago and just bought it again earlier this week. The formula has definitely changed. It’s super runny now, separates even while it’s still in the bottle, and gives almost no coverage. The old version had a nice gel-like texture and gave medium coverage with a healthy glow. Now it just feels like tinted water.

Also, keep in mind that stores might still have the old formula as the tester, so what you try in-store might not be what you actually take home. This has been a great foundation! I don't like super heavy foundation so this was medium to lightweight but still provided good coverage. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is it can get creasy after a long day of wear. But I've been complimented on how flawless my skin looks using this and a loose powder. I don’t usually leave reviews but felt like I needed to for this one. I have a really hard time finding foundations that look good on my skin. I have combination skin and every foundation either makes my my skin too oily or clings to dry patches. Estee Lauder Double Wear has always been my holy grail as it’s the only thing that has stayed on flawlessly for hours. As I’m getting older, I’m getting more fine lines that are emphasized with the EL formula so I started looking for something more lightweight. That’s where this foundation comes in. It is amazing!! So hydrating but does not make my skin oily at all. I was able to wear it yesterday for 12 hours and have it not separate or get oily. And it makes your skin look like skin, but better. Also, for girlies like me that are starting to get fine lines, this foundation is amazing and helps hide those. Can’t believe I’ll be leaving my EL in the past after 10 years but I’m so glad to have found something that makes me feel beautiful even as I’m aging! I am loving the result after using this foundation I love this foundation, I recommend it to literally EVERYBODY. I use it on myself and on my clients and I have never had any issues with it. looks beautiful on dry skin, oily, acne prone, mature skin. I’ve tested it on all skin types when doing makeup and it looks beautiful on everybody. this foundation has a beautiful medium coverage that you can sheer out to a tint if you like, and that you can layer to full coverage without it getting cakey. it also wears well and performs beautifully throughout the day, if set properly it lasts the entire day and the days I don’t set it it still lasts well and wears away in a way that doesn’t look too bad at the end of the day. I’ll maybe just have some smudging around the area my glasses sit which is typical of all foundations for me if I don’t set them properly.

I first received this product as a free training product but I have since then repurchased it because I love the formula so so much. out of all foundations sold at sephora, this is my favourite natural-looking foundation. It’s not too glowy but it’s also not matte either. it’s a perfect multi use foundation and I will continue to repurchase it. I’ve been using this product in my makeup routine for years, I can’t seem to even explore new foundations after this. It’s magnificent. Covers my red spots instantly, hide blemishes, and is hydrating and buildable. My only issue is with the packaging which can sometimes get messy. The product is very good, love its texture and how it blends. However i am not able to use this much because the sephora sales person sold me a darker shade…no doubt its great product but all my money was wasted as am goiam going  going 1 tone darker which doesn’t look good, beware o when selecting ur shade. This foundation base is a game-changer! It glides on smoothly, blurs imperfections, and provides a flawless, natural-looking finish. Lightweight yet buildable, it keeps my makeup in place all day without feeling heavy or cakey. My skin looks radiant and even-toned. A must-have for any makeup routine! I’ve been using this foundation for about 2 years now I definitely prefer this then any other product it’s lightweight a very nice not too dewy finish and almost full coverage I just layer it after it dries in the areas I want to cover a little extra I don’t really use concealer great full coverage,  long lasting beautiful foundation.  I wore all day while outside in hot weather abd sweating. never melted off and stayed looking freshly applied This is my favorite foundation. It feels like I'm not wearing any makeup, but covers beautifully. The perfect balance! Ordered it for the first time.  I love it 😀 It's little dry on my skin my all time favorite There is none better foundation to give a soft glow look than nars one. I truly love it 😍 It's my holy grail product for sure!!! I absolutely love it 😍 gifts, but my niece loves them love it. It sleeps on the skin perfectly and is very good for daily use! #sweepstakes Blends and melts into the skin with dewy finish. Love the color match. First time trying this foundation and it had quickly became my every day go-to! The  consistency is very thin and melts into your face, it looks gorgeous and natural while still providing coverage. I've noticed it works best on me if I use my fingers instead of brushes. 

#sweepstakes Could use more moisturizing qualities. after a few hours, my forehead started getting dry I have not been able to make this work on my skin. It starts getting really dry and it looks patchy. The shade match tool was also not accurate. I input a couple shades I use of other foundations and the match it gave me is way too light Nars foundation is the only beauty product I don't go drugstore/cheap on because it's worth it. #sweepstakes It's fine I was hoping it would have shinier finish. The color fits me, same as my skin. I use this with setting powder. They are good to be together. This is one of my favorite foundations. It wears beautifully and the color matches me perfectly. The best part is it was on sale. Great light coverage!! I get a lot of compliments because it looks like my skin! This is the best liquid foundation for my 53 year old face!!  It blends out beautifully and looks so natural! I have consistently used NARS foundation for years.  Won't touch another brand.  It has the perfect skin tone and undertone.  I recently purchased Huahine after getting a light tan.  No prior testing - just based on my prior purchase and undertone.  It's a perfect match.  Love this brand. No word to say how much I love it The best foundation for a sensitive and mature skin, it covers everything yet is very light and almost not felt on the skin. It also lasts all day. I love that it is very hydrating and my skin doesn't dry at the end of the day. Love this foundation!  It can be layered for more coverage, or worn light for a more daytime/casual look.  My skin looks healthy.  I have had several people want to know what I was doing different with my foundation when I switched to this particular formula!  Please don't discontinue!!!! So I actually really like this foundation! Previously, I was using the sheer glow foundation in Deauville. That shade matched me perfectly but sometimes that formula would show dry spots on my face. When I read the reviews for this eyeshadow a lot of the users had mature skin and said that it did not accent those flaws that come with aging skin. I'm 40, and so far I found this to be true! I do always use an oil or a lotion plus a sunscreen on my face and I haven't noticed anything standing out yet. I do find that this foundation is a little more watery than my other foundations even when I shake it up. But I don't mind that at all. The other thing I did notice is the shade is definitely different sheer glow. I got the same shade, Deauville and it's significantly darker. So I did go online and purchase the shade lighter and I'll see how that goes. Worst case scenario I figure I can mix the two based off of my skin tone at the moment. I do tend to darken up in the summer, like most people. But as far as the formula goes, it's great! It doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin, I like that there's no smell, and it has great coverage for me. I bought this product with reluctance, but once I used it, it stayed on my face all day. There was no cakey feeling, just a stylish and polished look. The makeup held up quite nicely even in hot weather. Would buy this again. Wrong color so it was really difficult to review the formula and wear. Tiny amount covers the whole face disappearing nicely. I used to love this product but this time I noticed it was very watery to the point that it falls off your face and you have to apply it quickly. Also the pump is really strange as it shoots quickly forward so you have to put your hand in the front to cover it and avoid a mess. The bottle shape is also different now I think this is their attempt to save on product but this smaller bottle size is very awkwardly shaped and strange to hold even. Overall, this is my last time buying this product. I am 68 y/o and have had a difficult time finding a foundation that doesn't look cakey or accentuate the lines around my eyes. This foundation provides what I want in this respect. I first tried it at my daughter-in-law's house. I was a little hesitatant to buy because it cost more than I was used to paying for a cosmetic, but after using for a couple of weeks I realized this bottle will last me many months because of how well it applies and covers.  I actually use very little for complete coverage and I feel it gives me the best results I've had for many years. I absolutely love this foundation. For one it feels amazing on your skin and you can tell the skin does well with the ingredients in it. I love that it can look glowy and natural or glam with a natural finish to it. I especially love the new shade Cordoba. Applies well with damp cosmetic sponge, buildable coverage. Light sheer or medium coverage.  NARS recommends to apply with fingers, but I find it blends more smooth and even with a damp cosmetic sponge. Love the product but hate the pump . It doesn't pump easily esp. when it starts getting low. 
Please replace . I have used other brands with much better mechanisms for pumping . Love it! Worst product it's lotion no coverage at all just vanishes in minutes This foundation was thick, heavy and mask-like. I tried it two times to give it a chance. Hated it!  Returned it. Cannot find a shade match in this range. Everything is crazy red and oxidizes like crazy. I feel like I've put so much money into trying out shades and left disappointed Repurchase item. Love the flexible coverage and natural finish. My favorite all around.  Works as a light application foundation as well as full coverage.  It's smooth, moisturizing, and creates a great base for the rest of your makeup.  All other products applied on top with Light Reflecting Advanced Skincare Foundation apply seamlessly!  Perfection! Amazing foundation This makes the skin look beautiful. The packaging was poor. The lid didn't lock well, causing the foundation to spill. It was a waste of money. I couldn't get this foundation off my face fast enough!  It feels like a mask, sticky and caked. I tried it twice, once with the smallest amount. It didn't work. I have oily combo skin. This is a beautiful foundation.  I am elderly and this is just glorious on my skin. I simply love it. I love how smooth it makes my skin look and light reflecting off my skin making it look hydrated It's a lovely foundation with a Dewey finish. A little goes a long way. The only thing I don't like about it is there is no way to open the container to get a small dab of it. You have to try and do the smallest pump of which I have been unsuccessful trying to do,and that's way too much waste if you just want a tiny dab. Perfection. Coverage is natural and thorough at the same time. I am on bottle #4. Worth the expense. I heard so many amazing things about this foundation. It was constantly recommended to me at cosmetics stores. Alas, none of the fair tones matched my skin. They were all way too yellow or way too pink. I generally opt for neutral foundations. My old favorite foundation was discontinued (yet again), so on my most recent search for a new one, I discovered this new Yulong shade. A different fair neutral from NARS. I tested it on my neck and was amazed by the color match. I immediately purchased it and I have used it ever since. The finish is beautiful. It's not too heavy on my sensitive skin, has the perfect buildable light-medium coverage, and lasts all day. It sets nicely on top of my Natasha Denona primer and stays with the now obsolete UD setting spray. All of my other products- mostly powder, some liquid and cream blushes- blend nicely into it without my base breaking or fading. I truly cannot see myself ever switching to another foundation as long as this formula stays the same and this shade remains in stock. I have the hardest time color matching and my shade seems to get discontinued often on other product lines, so I worry this shade won't be popular enough to keep around but fingers crossed. For reference, I'm a 125 Fenty and a 0N Dior. Good quality my wife loves it I use this product as my foundation, have since Laura Mercier discontinued the PhotoFinish product. The reason I bought so many bottles? For whatever reason,  you have discontinued the color I wear: Yukon. None of your new colors work for me, so I stocked up. I will note that a combination of Yukon + Oslo (one pump each) is absolutely perfect for my skin color. My supply should last for a good while! Perhaps you could concoct the color I have developed on my fingers... My order was delivered so fast , I was really happy, I ran out of my item and thought it would take awhile to receive it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My only frustration is my foundation color is not available in the stores any longer, and now have to order it as they still have it on Nars website. This is great foundation. Unfortunately, I decided to get clever and try a different shade from my usual, and this is a bit dark on me, so I'm mixing my old one and this one for a good summery shade. Such a great formulation. It works on my 52-year-old skin with no creasing, and good hydration. I use the Milk hydro grip primer. This foundation goes on light and barely looks like I have anything on my face. I liked how this foundation was easy to apply and even out my skin tone. Unfortunately, the make up looked and felt very thick on my skin and ultimately caused some acne breakouts. I need a foundation that is much lighter and lets my skin breathe better so I will be discontinuing use. It clings to my textured skin :( A staple for me! Love it! I doubted the color match tool but it worked great!! Perfect match. NARS is quickly becoming my favorite makeup brand. I wear this foundation daily and it never fails me. Even if my skin is extremely dry or I have some texture, it looks amazing every time. No other foundation I've ever tried quite compares to this one. 

I have dry skin in the winter and just normal skin in the summer and it works beautifully for both. I have heard women with oily skin also rave about it so I think it's really just a miracle product. Love it very much just that might try one shade lighter. It was amazing how perfectly it matched my skin tone. I used the online try on option cause I didn't know my color and it selected it perfectly I was new to Nars & after my granddaughter who is an esthetician owning her own salon recommended NARS as one of the better cosmetics I decided to try. After buying Light Reflecting foundation in color Santa Fe, and using for 6 months, I can truly say without a doubt this foundation is an absolute holy grail to all I've tried. I can't even feel it on my skin even at the end of the day. Not heavy, doesn't lay on top of skin like a mask, doesn't settle into fine facial lines, not sticky or cakey. Loved it so much I've added NARS blushes, lipsticks to my makeup bag. I just ordered (from Ulta Beauty) the NARS longwear foundation and hoping for same results which…. I'm sure it will be. NARS cosmetics are one of the top best cosmetics in my opinion and trust me! At my age at 71 I've tried them all. Looks like skin 🥰 I've already got a container of this that I use all the time. It is smooth, covers well, though it's fairly light coverage, goes on extremely well with a good foundation brush, hydrates my skin, and sticks to my hydro grip primer. I'd be game to try the NARS primer, too, once I'm out. I just happened to get a wild hair and thought, what if I'm using the wrong color for my undertone?! And I bought something way too dark for my translucent skin. Not their fault! My new favorite. My go-to for medium coverage.  Love this formula. I had been wearing the shade Namibia for several years, it was a great match for my skin tone but with new new shade releases I decided to try Timaru...WOW!! It's a perfect match, undetectable and flawless. My dry, sensitive skin already adores the moisturizing, non-irritating formula, so this new, perfect shade is just a 6th star!!! Horrible foundation! No coverage 
, and it's the very first foundation I've used that's crumbling, spalling and flaking no matter what applying method I've tried. I even purchased nars own primer to try to save it, doesn't work! Frustrated excellent product I'm 44 and have tried so many foundations high end and drug store and this is it this is my foundation it's so beautiful on the skin blends perfectly I bought this because it was recommended for ""mature skin"" as foundations often cake into lines, enhancing them. Unfortunately the reason this doesn't do that seems to be because it barely provides any coverage. I have some redness in my face and it doesn't help hide it. Love that it only takes a small amount and has great coverage. I like this base very much. The color is just a touch off but not bad for not trying it on in a store. Hard to get a perfect match online. Would buy again. But I bought an extra pump because a reviewer said that was needed. It is NOT necessary as it comes with a pump. Nice sheer coverage and terrific shade match. Looks great without looking like it is there. Light. Lasts with setting powder. I liked the foundation I have been using this product for a long time. I love this foundation. 
My complaint is that I hate the pump.  It does not deliver a smooth flow.
Most of the time it gets stuck and I have to keep pressing it.  I switch off to another brand because it delivers the product much more easily. Perfect match. Love this foundation. Perfect i love it. I went through many foundations for my aging skin. I hit 30s and have to be more picky. Needless to say this is the only one that didn't look cakey and settle in my fine lines. This is the perfect foundation and honestly wish I would have also had it in my 20s. The formula is great, light but gives good coverage. I suffer from sensitive skin where any makeup breas me out, but this foundation has never ever broken me out, it is my holy grail. Unfortunately this shade did not suit me, I usually use Tahoe but I thought this matched my skin better and I was wrong. THe one star missing is because of the shade range, I don't think I can continue using NARS foudations because I always get feedback from friends that the shade is off. Maybe if I got a different shade this would have gone better. The shade Yukon is horrifically ORANGE. So unwearable for a ""light"" category foundation. Will likely return because there's no ""making it work"" I love this makeup. It doesn't settle into fine lines. Covers but doesn't look like too much. No need for under eye cream. Very moisturizing. Works for me and also works for my daughter. I love it. Is there any way we can get a light cool-toned shade that's in between Oslo and Vienna?  The Oslo is too light, whereas the Vienna is too dark. Zero transfer.  I love it but sadly it's the wrong color for me.  I was advised this color by an expert.. now what? This looks so natural. I ordered few shades darker as it mimicked a natural tan, and has a beautiful glow! Looks very natural not too heavy I applied it with the Tacha dewy skin crème as moisturizer before hand let  settle in my skin for 3 min. Then I added the milk hydro grip primer . Loved light n smooth Amazing foundation for summer.feels like skin Feels like skin with good coverage. Radiant The BEST EVER foundation. This is the perfect foundation for a night out or when you want a little extra coverage with just the right hint of glo. It blends out easily and last all day without caking or creasing. It wears well under makeup or alone for a more natural look. I like the texture of this foundation and how it goes on. This came highly recommended as easy to use for beginners, which I am. Unfortunately, I missed the mark with choosing the shade; apparently I am way paler than I thought I was. This stuff is great - full coverage, but doesn't look like I have makeup on, just a healthy glow! Great foundation Perfect match It was okay, but I wouldn't grab for it out of my collection Love the feel and look of this foundation I do love the formula of this foundation but I am not able to get a good color match. The combination of Oslo and Mont Blanc  gives me the perfect color match but I do not want to have to buy 2 shades in order to make 1 good shade. The foundation is too expensive for that. I also tried shade Yulong which also was not a good color match. Too bad! For now I will stick w Patrick Ta crème foundation in fair 2 which matches my color perfectly. I have dry, mature skin with rosacea. I am really disappointed I am not able to find a good color match. I'm 45, normal-sensitive skin.Black hair. Fair skin-cool undertones (I can also wear neutral). Vienna is perfect! Not too shiny or matte. It's the perfect natural finish! Doesn't look caked on either Love this foundation! I have been watching it for sometime and finally decided to try it! So glad that I did.  Perfect collaboration between coverage, national finish, and base for other make up Perfect match to my skin. Feels light, looks smooth. The coverage is smooth and natural, and it blends like a dream. It lasts all day without feeling heavy or cakey, and it gives my skin a flawless finish. Definitely a go-to in my makeup routine. Highly recommend! I use it pretty often with the radiant creamy concealer and it's been really wonderful. Definitely worth the price. I bought this for my mother a few years ago and finally decided to give it ago for myself. 100% the best foundation I have every used. I'm able to do full face glam and more casual looks. Will be buying again and again. I have a combination of oily dry skin, and I always apply daily moisturizing lotion by cerave before my makeup and then elf's poreless face primer and then Nars foundation and it is the best one I have found yet I'm definitely obsessed and I get comments on my makeup all the time of course I top it off with Fenty beauties lavender pro filter. I highly recommend. I have tried other foundations and ALWAYS come back to this! Gives a dewy finish and doesn't break me out! The sales associate in your store picked out the color for me. It was too light. I love a glow foundation however I have oily skin and it's always too shiny, this was so perfect and light I will most definitely keep using this product! It blends really well and its buildable Stays on all day
Does not have a yellow tint.
Not heavy on face. I made the purchase, which was a splurge, based on the offer of a free gift. The free gift never came, and the receipt said that it was out of stock. It is shameful that in an age of computerization you would continue to offer a free gift that you do not honor. This is false advertising. Can't say enough good things. I absolutely love this foundation. It has been my top pick for years and i hate using any other foundation. Its a bit pricey but its pricey because its amazing. It makes your face looks perfect, but also not cakey or fake. It has a natural application and blends well with blush and contour over it. I always top with the nars compact setting powder and it wears long. Highly recommend! Also to note, a little goes a long way. I wear makeup 5 or 6 days a week and a bottle lasts me about 4 months give or take I've been buying this for years, I guess I got a defective cap. We were traveling and got to our destination and it came open and leaked inside my makeup bag. I had to go to a department store and replace it while we were traveling. I'm going to be returning this bottle to the store today. Hopefully this is just one case of this happening. I don't love the price, but I do love how it looks on my textured skin. It's also the closest match I have ever had. It appears skin like, is smoothing, and mixes well with all of my skin care. I wear the shade Lagos, and I can only find it at Ulta, I hope they don't get rid of it!!! I wanted so much to love this foundation and make it work, but it just didn't for me which is sad because it did help my skin.  It oxidized on me, settled into every line, wrinkle, and pore, and looked like a shiny mask. The amount of money I've spent on this foundation and trying various things to make it work is obnoxious so I have to replace it. Switched to NARS after using Estee and I love how dewy (but not too dewy) and natural this looks on my skin. Feels natural without feeling heavy. This foundation is absolutely gorgeous. It goes on beautifully and stays throughout the day. It is definitely a dewy finish it that is what you are looking for. Unfortunately i could not get past the smell. I am not super sensitive when it comes to smells, but this straight up smells like im putting bug spray or something on my face. Its not just a light smell either its very strong and pungent. I do get hormonal breakouts at times (I'm 53), but not THAT bad, I really think this made my skin break out. And the match quiz did not help me, Valarius is too orange for me. Pretty disappointing and a waste of quite a few dollars. I've spent over 25 years wearing EsteeLauder, converted to Revlon to break up costs and to get a tad more moisture as I age.  EL I'm Cashew color.  I was matched up Barcelona (which was too light for me) or Valencia (which was too orange for me). Revlon I have to buy 2 colors to mix.  Nars, well I love their blushes.  Their foundation seemed to be loved by many,  so I thought I'd try out of boredom.... first off, when I say it's runny,  I mean,  you literally need a drop. its almost like I dumped an entire bottle of serum into my foundation.  Yes,  that's how runny it is,  even when rubbing into my face.  I looked like a wet wax face.  It felt uncomfortable like I wanted to itch it off. Even with a setting powder it was wet.  Other makeup did NOT blend well at all either. Side note,  I have PCOS, so I need full coverage.  This is probably the furthest from medium/full/build able coverage.  So it's a huge no for me.  Not only that,  during the day I kept getting a wiff of something rancid on my face.  I have sensitive skin. Made where I shave,  turn red and seap through.  I'll stick with what I use.  Love Nars, but not the foundation.  Probably perfect for people who want a BB cream lol I wore this foundation for a full day to do a wear test and see how the product looked from running around all day... I'll give it a 7/10.

Shade match (Oslo) was perfect!... for a hour. Got in the car, flicked open the mirror, and BAM! Orange! Nothing else wrong with the product though. 

I'll compliment the formula. I have combination skin and a lot of products get patchy around my nose and the apples of my cheeks. This foundation didnt, however, I did have to apply multiple layers for full coverage. Definitely buildable!

If the product didnt oxidize so much it would've been 10/10, 5 stars, but I did end up returning the foundation. I did not like this.  Texture was like an extra thin serum and I found it hard to work with.   Also settled into wrinkles. Ive been using this foundation for years not and nothing compares. Great color match for my skin, love the thinner texture, gives medium to full coverage and doesn't look heavy or cakey on my skin Foundation is beautiful on my skin, one of the best colour matches ever, like it was made exactly for my skin. Very natural appearance, covers slight imperfections even with a light application. Very comfortable on skin even in the ungodly heat of summer. FINALLY a perfect color match for my pale skin!
Hydrating, but not in a heavy way! It's been such a journey finding a formula and shade that works for me. I'm absolutely in love with this foundation and its build-ability and find myself doing my make up more often because of it a great foundation This is my favorite foundation! Definitely worth your money. I have dry skin and this foundation hydrates while not leaving too much of a dewy finish. Would recommend!! Its truly a beautiful foundation, very light weight however it does not cover my acne scars 😩 ive tried to built it up as well. Unfortunately will be returning for aomething more full coverage! This brand was recommended to me by a sales clerk and I love it. Some foundations are heavy and actually accentuate fine lines, but this one is lightweight and doesn't sit or cake in any creases or lines. Great for mature skin. I really wanted to like this foundation but it melts super easily even with lots of setting spray. I have normal-oily skin and it is summer now but it just does not stay on well. It initially does blend nice and is lightweight though. This is the only foundation that I have found that does not separate.  I have spent a small fortune trying to find a foundation  that works for me only to be disappointed so many times. I like the fact that this is not drying. It has a slight dewy finish, but not too much. I have almost used an entire bottle. I will purchase again. When I tell you shade Yulong is the perfect shade for the pale girls who are more neutral but a little pink omg. Ive never had a better foundation match ever and the finish is so skinlike plus it has skincare benefits like okay girl! Only thing i dislike is how tight fitting the cap is, makes me worried im going to accidentally throw it or something trying to get it off lol I rarely write reviews unless absolutely needed and this one gets it. This makes my skin look amazing and I love the fact it has skincare helping ingredients. A little goes along way and the bottle is a good size,  however the pump just kinda gives too much so be careful. my skin looks luminous but like my skin not makeup just in love! fingers are the best to apply. A brush is ok and sponge works great too but I feel the hand does a better job since its so liquidy. Good coverage & good for summer. I have mixed feelings about this product. I initially tried it because I am very pale and was having a hard time finding the right shade in my previous brand. This brand had a shade that seemed good for me. I use a brush to apply it. It goes on smooth and is a great match for my tone. However, I find it very expensive for how long it lasts and I don't even wear makeup everyday. I like the pump top but when it gets low, it is almost impossible to get everything out of the bottle. I even bought one of the little tools to help get out all of the product but the shape of this bottle makes it so difficult to get it all out even with the little tool. I find myself using a cheaper brand (that isn't even the right color) if I'm just slumming around town as I don't want to waste the expensive makeup for a random day. Needed a light weight foundation for the summer. My normal foundation is Estée Lauder Double Wear but it always feels too heavy for the summer months. This Nars foundation is the perfect medium coverage that feels pretty light on the skin. I do have normal to oily skin so I have to set with powder and use setting spray to make it last all day without feeling oily. I love this foundation so much! The color, the glow, everything is flawless! I hope they never discontinue this! It's light and feels good on my skin Such a great foundation, however; the worst pump EVER! Its gets stuck or splash everywhere. I dont know how many stains on my clothes I have from the pump. Come on Nars, its a simple fix! This stuff is beautiful on the skin! I'm 45 and I had bad acne in my youth. I have scars and my skin pulls quite red even now at my age. This covers everything, looks fresh. Skin like finish that's not flat but NOT oily. My new fav 🙌 While I love the foundation, the pump has always had the issue of spraying out droplets of makeup after the initial pump. Very wasteful and messy! This use to be my favorite foundation, formula change and no longer like it , more dry make my skin look more mature Bought this a month ago. Love the foundation but the bottle design is AWFUL --pump was so rigid, too little or too much liquid comes out. Then, the pump got stuck inside the bottle top. I couldn't remove it. Far too expensive for so many issues! I've been searching for the perfect foundation for years and I think I finally may have found it. My skin is on the dryer side and foundation always has aged me and made me look worse. This looks and feels just like a second skin. It goes on so smooth and doesn't feel thick.

Ive tried lancome, too faced, estee lauder, tarte, and so many other foundations and none compare to this one! LOVE this fountain. My skin is glowing!!! I saw a friend wearing this. Her face was glowing, and she looked 10 years younger. I bought the same shade the day I saw her wearing it. I absolutely love this foundation but there are two dealbreakers for me: 1) it oxidizes almost immediately on me (shade oslo ends up very warm and peachy) and 2) it tends to settle into the creases of my nose and lines between my eyebrows. it's also not as buildable as I feel it's made out to be, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. I love how lightweight and dewy it is om my very dry, sensitive skin. if it stayed looking the way it does before oxidizing, this would be my holy grail I was hoping to switch from IL MAKIAGE to NARS, but this makeup does not stay put for the entire day, even with primer and setting spray. It feels runny and thin. It also settled in fine lines. I'm sure this is great coverage for younger skin, but not at all for mature women. Color was great, but I need foundation that stays consistent through the work day. This foundation is a little watery. The coverage is good but I think I'd prefer something a little more thicker. The product is thin and goes on easy. My face looks natural but also covers any facial problems. My face looks illuminated. I love it. I did not like this foundation. It didn't look matte or light-reflecting at all. It looked like drugstore makeup that was applied poorly and sat as a second layer on my face. I would not buy this again and especially not at its price point. To watery. Not sure if this is a one off. This is my favorite foundation by far. Applys easy. A little goes a long way. It blends well with my skin and doesnt break me out. This is my favorite foundation by far. Applys easy. A little goes a long way. It blends well with my skin and doesnt break me out. Is super easy to apply, great coverage (a little goes a long way)! Can hardly tell I have it on. Went on very smoothly and I love it. I will be getting more of the products. Product was too watery Okay, I love Nars.  Have combination skin. Was able to find the perfect shade.  The finish dried a little to flat and matte.  It would be ideal to wear if you need the make up to last.  This would be a great  back up makeup not an every day.  If you have oily skin...maybe your everyday. This foundation is 100% worth the price. Its buildable coverage so you can decide how you want it to look. It covers acne but is somehow so thin and light. I use Mont Blanc becuase I'm so pale but it matches perfectly and doesn't oxydize. I recommend this to everyone buy it now!! Highlights: looks natural on skin and blends well with other products. Has a slight dewy finish and feels lightweight and works well with my dry skin.

Not my faves: It doesn't cover my rosacea super well on its own but it is buildable. also it has a slight yellow hue to it on my skin. This was recommended by a friend of mine. Unfortunately its not for me. 

It has a dewy finish. It is full coverage no doubt. The application is easy. You can use your fingers, brush, beauty blender etc. There is no scent to it. 

This product it not meant for my matte and oily babes. You could use setting powder, but in most cases it will just emphasize texture and cakeyness. It can transfer onto other things from face to hand, sweat to clothing. I would probably use this product during the colder seasons where the weather will not melt my face, but I will have to wait and see. I was searching for a foundation that was not thick & heavy on my skin. I wanted a foundation that looked natural on my face. After years of using Clinique and finding it no longer was working for me due to aging skin i was on the hunt. When a family member who is an esthetician & makeup artist recommended NARS, i decided to give it a try. BINGO! This light reflecting foundation is exactly what i was looking for. Light but with great coverage and behaves like a second skin for a flawless look. I have never been a huge foundation person since my skin is insanely dry and sensitive and cannot tolerate even niaminicide. I heard that this foundation has been successful for other acne prone people, so I decided to give it a try. I love the way this blends onto my skin and the fact that it is buildable. I find it works well with the pink elf grip primer and I use the L'oreal Infalliable 24 hr concelear for my under eyes ontop of the nars and it works great! No patches or anything. I am glad I finally found a foundation that works for my sensitive acne prone skin. 
I took off one star for the packaging, since I find that the dispenser gets stuck in the lid often. This is the first foundation that has made me break out like crazy. Within the first week I had about 20 zits around my forehead and lower face and the only went away once I discontinued use. I also looked super orange lol. I guess it wasn't for me. This is the first foundation that has made me break out like crazy. Within the first week I had about 20 zits around my forehead and lower face and the only went away once I discontinued use. I also looked super orange lol. I guess it wasn't for me. I got the color Deuville. I'm so impressed with it so far. My nostril area looks nice now with makeup. I used setting spray first then the nars light reflecting primer before the foundation. Withstands sweat and oil pretty well. Lovely product! This is perfect color for me and goes on my mature skin nicely. Very happy with this foundation. Will buy again. I generally like this foundation. Its a good match for my skin tone, i wear shade Olso. It stays looking good all night. I set it with the translucent light reflecting pressed powder from Nars and then spray on benefits setting spray when im all done with makeup. I feel like it may cause blemishes, im not 100% sold its solely from this yet, so i typically use it for important meetings or a night out. A huge benefit is it just looks beautiful in photos. Super smooth even skin tone in every picture with flash. It does have a kinda gross smell when applying but seems to go away fast. I generally like this foundation.

Super smooth even skin tone in every picture with flash. It does have a kinda gross smell when applying but seems to go away fast. I have to be honest. After I bought this, I took it back to Ulta to return. I told the gentleman that it did not seem to be working well for me. He asked me how I was applying it. I told him with my makeup brush. He encouraged me and also showed me how to apply it with my fingers. This foundation does beautifully once warmed up with your fingers and gently smoothed out on the face. I have tried a lot of foundations, and this is now hands-down, my absolute favorite foundation. Bottle leaks. Returned twice to see if it was a faulty bottle. However, the foundation itself is great. As im getting older is been hard to dind a foundation and omg this is great it looks smooth, does not sit on fine lines, light feeling and last all day. Definitely worth the price I absolutely love this foundation. I can not imagine using anything else for my skin. I have tried so many different foundations...some ok and some awful. This one is perfect. My skin is more on the dry side and this foundation is just the right viscosity and texture to make my skin look dewy and smooth. I have some fine lines and this does not settle into them which I'm thrilled about. Theres a reason why I keep replenishing this product, the quality and great eith mu skin, im buying another bottle ad we speak! I have oily skin and if you add a little powder it wears beautifully!!!! at the end of the day it's glowy and gorgeous I absolutely love this foundation! It looks great in photos and even better in person. It's a lightweight formula that doesn't cake or pill. The coverage is medium and buildable. I switched over from MAC, because it's a lot more forgiving! Recommend! I used to wear MAC STUDIO FIX FLUID SPF foundation, but I noticed that it started looking terrible on my skin, as I got older (late 30's with a few fine lines, where the foundation was settling). I was looking for something a bit more forgiving that would make my skin glow. This foundation has been a life saver! It isn't at all thick or cakey, it goes on smoothly, and it lasts all day (with a setting spray). Highly recommend! This did not look good on my skin. It flaked and made my lines show more. The color was correct and I tried multiple different applications but the end result after a few minutes was always the same. I prepped my skin beforehand also as others suggested. I love Nars foundation. When it time for a replacement I decided to try light reflecting. It was just not for me. It is very runny and settles in my face. I will go back to their sheer glow formula. I love the full coverage. I wore this two nights in a row, and even slept in it one night, and my acne prone, dry skin did not break out! Foundation covers acne blemishes beautifully, and has a dewy (non-oily) finish! Seems to match my skin well. Always have that problem finding a foundation that will match up to my skin just right. I have only used a few times. I only got it a few days ago. Not enough time to review it. Price, I guess is good. Other places had it cheaper. I have a Ulta card. So that is where I buy my makeup products. So far I like it. I put everyone onto this foundation and they love it and have started to use it I love this foundation, but many of the light shades lean yellow. If they were truer to neutral and cool, I would definitely repurchase this foundation. I LOVE this foundation!!! Tried many other brands (prestige & common) and this is the only one that works for my skin! I'm 39 with dry/combo skin, and I've NEVER had an issue with coverage or buildability. I use NYX Marshmellow Primer, then apply foundation with a sponge, and finish with setting spray. Good to go, all day! made a switch from silicone-base to water-base, and this product was life changing. I still love my MAC studio fix but this is giving it. Run for its money!

Perfect for my dry skin. Honestly as a matte foindation girly, I hated it!! It made me face SO shiny and it felt so oily on my skin. I love how a little goes a long way though. I wanted to love so bad because its not bad but way too shiny for my taste. Honestly as a matte foindation girly, I hated it!! It made me face SO shiny and it felt so oily on my skin.

It is very smooth and makes me base look flawless. The pump can be annoying at times but I just make sure it's close to my skin so it won't squirt elsewhere. I use one full pump for my full face. The coverage and finish is beautiful. This is one of my holy grails!! Ordered the new shade yulong and it was the best match I have had for my fair, sensitive skin. It looks like my skin but with a natural filter ! This foundation provides good coverage and matches my skin tone. After applying it, I felt my skin became very soft and smooth. I like this brand a lot. Nice coverage. I like the texture as well. It does rub on clothes easily. So far the best liquid foundation that I have purchased. It's lightweight, no perfumey smell, and the coverage is amazing. I have always struggled to find the right shade, for Nars in general. When the Light Reflecting Foundation launched in 2022, I bought 5 different shades, and returned the foundations that were way off. So when I heard that 15 new shades were released, I gave it one more chance, because I love the way Nars Foundations felt on my skin. Then I saw the shade Lanai shade Medium 2.25 and I went to try it in store. I had a gut feeling, this shade would be the one, and it really is the one. The foundation is beautiful. I wear Patagonia and I have dry skin. I'm older and it does not settle into lines on my face. The color looks good. It does have a bit of a problem adhering to the skin on my nose so I'm in the process of finding a primer for this issue. Why I'm writing this review is to warn others that the glass bottle neck can get permanent stuck inside the black plastic lid of the product. I had to spend money and order a second bottle because I could not get the bottle out once it got stuck and I could not completely close the bottle. I'm not the only person with this problem as evidenced by some reviews here and elsewhere online. This is so upsetting. I hope NARS changes their bottles so this won't keep happening. My review stars do not reflect the bottle issue. This liquid foundation is a five star item and that's how I rated it. I have been on the hunt for a good medium coverage foundation for some weddings I have coming up in the next year, as I usually only wear skin tints. This is perfect! It evens out my complexion and plays will with my other products - no separation! It also looked like I just applied after a reception full of dancing. Amazing!

The lady at the Morristown, TN location took extra time color matching my skin. This is the foundation that she and I both agreed matched to a 'T'. A little goes a long way! It just didn't work for my skin. It cracked around my nose and just didnt blend well. Im not sure if it was my skincare routine that did not react well with the makeup or what. Have to return I purchased this after the Ulta employee assured me this perfomed the same as Nars Radiant foundation. Could not be more opposite! This adds texture to my skin and is super patchy. And it separates after an hour. I tried all the different application methods and none worked. I used the primers suggested, the using my fingers instead of a brush or sponge, i tried it all. Nothing worked. Its the foundation. Will be going back to my ABH luminous foundation. I am in my  60's and I was using Lorac Porefection, but it's no longer available. I've tried to find something that didn't look drying or sink into my fine lines. I like a glowy look. I tried Laura Geller for amture skin and hated it, way too dry looking for me. I love this Nars light reflecting is the perfect coverage, not heavy or cakey and does give your skin a glowy look all day.",4.053333333333334,300
