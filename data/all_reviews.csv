bazaarvoice,sephora_ca,2557999,Dior Forever Skin Glow,5,2025-09-16 02:56:02+00:00,PandaMochi,"I think I may have found my holy grail foundation! It was a long struggle as I was deciding between lancome teint idol, dior forever skin glow/matte or haus lab foundation.  I first bought lancome, it was alright but I wasn't loving it and for the price I should be loving it, so I went back and exchanged it for dior. 

I usually go for matte cause i like a soft blur effect (especially around the pores).  Although I always wanted a radiant finish too, I was worried it would look oily or emphasize my texture and pores. However, based on my various research (youtube video), many reported the matte and skin glow version bring similar with slight difference in finish. With the weather getting colder, i do want my skin to be more hydrated, so i got skin glow, and im loving it. It has a slight satin effect at first, especially with powder. The glow becomes more apparent over time, but it won't look oily but actually more skin like with a healthy hydrated look. It's still transfer proof and longevity it good too. By the 9h work, it started to separate but only a little, and it's very easy to fix up without it affecting the rest of the face.

I actually compared it with haus lab (i got a sample) cause I heard great things about it, and i really love how haus lab looked on my hand when I was swatch both in the store. It was smoother and more radiant than dior but also seems it would transfer more. When trying both on with powder, the transfer is no longer an issue. Interestingly, at first, haus lab looked more radiant AND powdery than dior, which looks soft and skin like. But after a while, both looked skin like but haus lab did settle into my pores a bit more. It also doesn't last as long as dior, since it started breaking apart around the 7h mark, but like dior it's easy to fix up without it affecting rest of the face.",77 CAD

It gives such a smooth and satin finish, gives decent coverage without being cakey at all. I have normal to dry skin, and this does not oxidize on me. I find it to be the same shade after many hours.

bazaarvoice,sephora_ca,2557999,Dior Forever Skin Glow,5,2025-04-20 17:23:10+00:00,,"BOMB BOMB BOMB I am obsessed. Perfect balance between sheer and medium coverage. Depending on how I feel and the look I want that day, I often just wear this as my base after moisturizer and primer and then add a little more under my eyes and-boom, perfect. Not only does it FEEL light, it hydrates dull skin without leaving a greasy film. My skin looks radiant and Dior Forever Skin Glow Hydrating Foundation has become a STAPLE in my makeup routine. 

OH BUT BEWARE — TEST THESE SHADES IN PERSON AT A STORE. Their naming system is very off (at least I found it to be). 

For some background, I have always been neutral toned, I have both green and blue veins in my arms and am a darn-near greenish yellow-olive undertone to my skin and go brown in the summer (no red, no pink, just golden brown). I spent over an HOUR testing all the different shades and tones and finally came to 0W. It is my EXACT match right now, however, it’ll be a different story when my skin sees the sun. Highly highly recommend going IN STORE and trying all of the shades because I never would have guessed I’d be “warm”.",77 CAD

It feels great on my skin and doesn’t look heavy even when you build it up to super full coverage, on a day to day I can achieve a light to medium coverage with it and it lasts the whole day. 

It isn’t transfer-proof but the way my skin looks and feels so healthy and glowy but not oily is perfect. There’s no weird clinging to dry patches, or separation due to oil. I really enjoy this foundation and highly recommend it just keep in mind it does oxidize when you’re shade matching!",77 CAD

I am a fair olive that needs less saturated shades. All of Nars shades are extremely pink or ORANGE, until Lima! I was very excited to finally be able to try an acceptable match. 

The color was fine, it could be less saturated but the best of any Nars shade. The formula felt a little heavy for me. It definitely has a makeup feel unlike most of my medium-coverage options. That's the first ding. 

The coverage and look were decent. I liked the finish for the most part, though it doesn't look like skin as much as many foundations. It definitely is a you're wearing makeup foundation. 

The worst part is skincare inside of it. I wish brands would STOP doing this. I have my own skincare. Whatever is in this stuff made me breakout badly, and I AM NOT AN ACNE PRONE/OILY GIRL. It really annoys me at this point.",73 CAD

As a sensitive skin, highly acne-prone girly, I am so frustrated by the trend lately where every. single. foundation. has to somehow be infused with hyaluronic acid, or some other on-trend ingredient.

Reliable formulas I've loved for years, some for more or less a decade, I now have to abandon because they reformulate, which leads to one or more of the following effects:

1) The makeup just sucks. It oxidizes, or comes out of the tube darker or some other tone than it used to, and generally doesn't match what it used to. 

2) It breaks you out. A makeup that used to be the HG for breakout-prone girlies is now part of the problem because they force ""skincare"" into the formula. So those of us who spent years hunting and came to rely on a foundation now have to abandon it and are shunned as loyal customers. 

3) It separates. More often than not, the ""skincare"" being blindly mixed into these foundations is not meant to mix with the types of formulas in the makeup. So you end up with a foundation that ends up separating on your face and looking disgusting, whereas the original formula used to last an entire day, .

I am so deeply disappointed and frustrated with the makeup industry lately. I can barely find a single cosmetic that doesn’t tout some “skin saving” ingredient anymore, and all I want is a simple foundation and concealer. I’m not interested in paying more for makeup that doesn’t even work half as well as it used to.

I am oily t zone and dry to normal cheeks combo and I thought matte foundation would be my thing but no. Mattes made me look patchy and separated bad around my nares. Full coverage finishes just aren't for me. The worker matched me to this shade and I love it so far! I didn't think this formula would fit well and last almost all day. I used the nars light reflecting primer before and a setting spray after I did my whole face. The foundation did pretty good with hours of me sweating bad on my oily t zone area.

It was constantly recommended to me at cosmetics stores. Alas, none of the fair tones matched my skin. They were all way too yellow or way too pink. I generally opt for neutral foundations. My old favorite foundation was discontinued (yet again), so on my most recent search for a new one, I discovered this new Yulong shade. A different fair neutral from NARS. I tested it on my neck and was amazed by the color match. I immediately purchased it and I have used it ever since. The finish is beautiful. It's not too heavy on my sensitive skin, has the perfect buildable light-medium coverage, and lasts all day. It sets nicely on top of my Natasha Denona primer and stays with the now obsolete UD setting spray. All of my other products- mostly powder, some liquid and cream blushes- blend nicely into it without my base breaking or fading. I truly cannot see myself ever switching to another foundation as long as this formula stays the same and this shade remains in stock. I have the hardest time color matching and my shade seems to get discontinued often on other product lines, so I worry this shade won't be popular enough to keep around but fingers crossed.

EL I'm Cashew color.  I was matched up Barcelona (which was too light for me) or Valencia (which was too orange for me). Revlon I have to buy 2 colors to mix.  Nars, well I love their blushes.  Their foundation seemed to be loved by many,  so I thought I'd try out of boredom.... first off, when I say it's runny,  I mean,  you literally need a drop. its almost like I dumped an entire bottle of serum into my foundation.  Yes,  that's how runny it is,  even when rubbing into my face.  I looked like a wet wax face.  It felt uncomfortable like I wanted to itch it off. Even with a setting powder it was wet.  Other makeup did NOT blend well at all either. Side note,  I have PCOS, so I need full coverage.  This is probably the furthest from medium/full/build able coverage.  So it's a huge no for me.  Not only that,  during the day I kept getting a wiff of something rancid on my face.  I have sensitive skin. Made where I shave,  turn red and seap through.  I'll stick with what I use.

I'm older and it does not settle into lines on my face. The color looks good. It does have a bit of a problem adhering to the skin on my nose so I'm in the process of finding a primer for this issue. Why I'm writing this review is to warn others that the glass bottle neck can get permanent stuck inside the black plastic lid of the product. I had to spend money and order a second bottle because I could not get the bottle out once it got stuck and I could not completely close the bottle. I'm not the only person with this problem as evidenced by some reviews here and elsewhere online. This is so upsetting. I hope NARS changes their bottles so this won't keep happening. My review stars do not reflect the bottle issue. This liquid foundation is a five star item and that's how I rated it.,54 USD

I’ve dealt with swollen eyes, rashes on my eyelids, under my nose, and around my mouth, and it took me over a month to figure out the culprit was Double Wear.

I completely overhauled my skincare routine thinking something else was to blame, and relied on prescription steroid cream just to manage the symptoms—only for the flare-ups to return. Once I eliminated Double Wear, my skin started improving.

I would agree that this provides medium coverage. That is sufficient for me as I don't have intense dark circles around my eye area. I think if you do have darker circles this in tandem with a color corrector would work quite well.

The formula is creamy and easy to apply. The applicator is a large doe foot that holds a fair amount of product. The product dries down to be matte and has a skin like finish. It blends out well into my makeup and is comfortable on my skin. I was satisfied with the longevity of the coverage but can't say for certain if it lasts 24 hours as I don't wear makeup that long…

I will say since it has a natural matte finish, it was important that I really hydrated my skin prior to applying this concealer. If I didn't it would settle a bit more into the lines on my face. Not a huge deal for me as most concealers perform much better with a fully prepped face.

The shelf life is 6 months. This gives me a bit of pause as I am not sure I can finish this all in 6 months. It would be great to have a mini one that's also half the price.

While it was costly, my friend encouraged me to try it, as I had acne scars that needed full coverage.  I have used Double Wear exclusively now for thirty years (gulp!!!) and I can tell you that, not only does it provide the full coverage that I continue to want, my skin has aged beautifully.  I do not have the wrinkles or age spots that a lot of my friends the same age have.  My daughter tells me all the time, mom, you have not aged!  I believe this is directly because I have used Double Wear to protect my skin for so many years.  I have tried other brands, but not for long.  I always come back to Estee Lauder.",67 CAD

It glides on smoothly and doesn't feel heavy or cakey, which is a huge plus.

The real game-changer is its longevity. I can wear it throughout the entire day, and it still looks fresh and flawless by the time I take it off. Whether I'm at work, running errands, or out in the evening, it holds up beautifully.

It has gone through at least 3 noticeable formula changes in that time. It started out as a thick, opaque, full coverage, everything-proof foundation and is now a mediocre, medium-at-best coverage, normal liquid foundation. The last two bottles I bought have oxidized in the bottle within 6-8 months, even when used with a pump immediately upon opening (so it is not exposed by the bottle opening) and being kept in a drawer. That alone will keep me from buying another. I also get oily after a few hours, even with proper prep and set. It oxidizes on my face over the course of the day and wipes off in places easily, so it looks patchy at various times as well. This just isn't the best on the market anymore and the price point is absurd for the lesser quality. I appreciate that it never causes issues for my acne prone skin and that it doesn't have a scent. The shades run very peachy and there is not a true olive shade (once it dries down and/or changes color over the day).

I love the coverage and always end up using too much because it doesn't have a pump. I have seen pumps for this on the internet and must remember to get one. You have to shake this formula to get the best out of it. It does last a really long time and it doesn't break apart. I think it's supposed to be a medium coverage and you are supposed to see your skin/freckels underneath it. I was trying to cover redness and used too much of this.
I think I used too much powder and too much foundation because I stopped using this after a few bad days with my makeup looking to heavy. I liked it better when I really prepped my skin with moisturizer and primer. If you have dryness and texture problems they can get magnified by the dry down of this formula. It's a super long lasting formula and is supposed to dry down, so it accomplishes that well. I didn't have a dewy setting spray at the time so I used what I had but I think it looks better after it's been worn for two hours or so. I think you need to be better than a beginner to use this. It needs the right supporting products to go with it. A setting spray that softens it, something like a primer to save the texture/pores you see, the right powder, and the nearly 60 shades to choose from makes it kind of tricky to use.
I tried it out because I got it on sale but I think I prefer others over this. I'm just getting back into makeup and need something a little more forgiving .",52 USD

It went on so well and held up all day in any condition. Upon purchasing a new bottle, it didn't apply well. The foundation would instantly look cakey in areas, settling in pores and lines, and certainly did last all day. Worst of all, the new formula gives me a terrible eye irritation. I know several other long time users experiencing similar issues. Really disappointed in the new formula and left to find a new foundation after all of these years!!!",52 USD

Giorgio Armani luminous silk - color 5.75

I haven't worn foundation in decades. The closest I've gotten has been tinted moisturizer from Walmart. 

Well, my skin has changed a lot in the past 15 years. I will be turning 60 next year, and I have acute liver disease.  I need more coverage than I have in the past because liver health directly impacts skin condition. 

I had been having trouble selecting an appropriate foundation color. The online color quizzes always ask what foundation I am already using. That is useless in my situation.

I've been struggling for a long time to find a foundation that would sit on top of all of that (especially my acne, which is always super dry), and not look or feel gross. This foundation feels very light and isn't too greasy or oily, while still being hydrating and not clinging to any dryness. It doesn't emphasize my texture at all, and works for all of my skin, which is nice because I have combination skin.

My skin is still very oily and has always had dry patches. This foundation came up a lot. Previously I was very happy (for years) with Tarte amazonian clay foundation. Something about the way it was applying now was bothering me. 
So I went into Sephora to try shades of this one. I'd planned on the lightest neutral, but the salesperson didn't agree with me lol. I lean more towards yellow, so she handed me #3. It was perfect on my arm, so I purchased it. It also looks great on my face. I apply very little to a brush and spread/buff it around. A little goes a long way. I didn't find that adding more added better coverage to my discolorations or old acne scars, but perhaps I'm just not layering it enough. I don't love a face thick with make-up, I prefer it to look like me, only better. And this foundation works well for me. It feels like nothing when on.
